"We love what we have available to stream on Disney+, but it's missing an important feature that me and many others have a problem with. There is no option to get rid of partially watched shows or movies from the ""continue watching"" section. VERY frustrating, especially when you give a TV show or movie a shot and decide you don't like it but are forced to see it in your continue watching section for a very long time.",2024-04-23 23:37:11,3
"This app is really getting on my nerves. I like that I can download and watch some movies at home but if there is any sort of interruption during the download process, it completely fails and you have to restart. It's also extremely slow when you want to delete a download. And, you can't leave the app if you want anything that's loading to continue its process. So basically, if your download fails because you lost internet connection or left the app you have to wait to re-download it.",2024-04-24 00:10:00,2
"TERRIBLE! Has NEVER worked. FREEZES constantly. Plays up to first commercial and freezes: sound and picture, but NO movement. After that, NOTHING! I have a Sony Bravia Smart TV with Android and have MANY other streaming apps, including HULU, with virtually NO issues. Have reported this problem to Disney website (Help) and to Spectrum and have jumped through ALL of the hoops over and over again, to no avail. The Service Rep could not help me. Wish Disney could get it together already and FIX IT!",2024-04-23 21:25:36,1
"Don't know why I keep bothering with these apps, DVD and VCR players never gave me problems. Streaming apps are just making life more complicated and expensive. The app keeps freezing, long loading time, replays movies and episodes when it reaches the end or is paused, does not save your recent episode, movies stay on ""continue watching"" even when finished, recently error messages have started popping up. Happening on all my devices, nothing wrong on my end.",2024-04-16 01:42:10,1
"I don't understand why this is the one app that doesn't keep track of where you are in a movie, so annoying to scrub through half the movie everytime I go to watch something, the annoying thing is, is that you don't even get the ability to scrub either, also I wanted to start my subscription again so I signed in and without even giving me an option it chose the highest subscription choice and instantly charged my card, like huh?",2024-04-21 05:09:00,1
"App has degraded significantly as of late. When casting with smartcast, the audio cuts out for a second every minute. Additionally, to cast a new title, you have to end the current casting session. Apparently, it is incapable of switching, a base function every other streaming platform is capable of. Navigation is good, but nothing that sets it apart from others.",2024-04-07 23:19:01,2
"doesnt skip intros or credits for episodes. Doesnt remember which series i was on when i return to the app. When i go back to the series and select the next episode, it just opens the one i was already watching instead of playing the next one. fast forward and rewind (while casting) is so slow, it takes 5 seconds to go back 10 seconds, and mashing the rewind button doesnt help. meaning i need to use the seek bar EVERY time, which has no timestamp while scrolling. unintuitive, buggy, broken.",2024-03-11 19:06:15,2
"the content is great. I just want to make that clear, but the use of this app, both on my phone and on my TV, is impossible to deal with. Im CONSTANTLY having to log in, only to have it say it can't log me in. I have had to change my password at least 20 times. it would have been more but I get so frustrated I don't bother for a week or so & watch other streaming services. I have 2 phones and 2 TVs that I watch on. I can't understand why other services have no problem logging in but not Disney+",2024-02-26 01:51:34,2
"Surround sound sucks for movies! I try to watch Disney/Marvel movies using this app that I pay for, instead of having to buy the movie discs. The surround sound is great for the TV shows on the app, although it is compressed, unfortunately; please provide an option to stream lossless audio. But when trying to watch movies, the sound is intentionally mutilated. No matter how I adjust the EQ on my Denon, the sound quality feels very hollow and barebones. PLEASE FIX THIS!",2024-04-18 22:44:20,1
"on console ps4/ps5. The playback will not select the correct video when trying to scroll down. For example if a show has 2 season. You will have to re-select a different season to refresh the page, otherwise the episode you select will be the wrong episode. If you don't have multiple season you seem out of luck as you have to manually rewind during playback to see previous episodes if it's glitching. Restarting, reinstalling and checking for updates has not helped so far. Please fix this.",2024-04-10 12:38:53,1
"By far the buggiest app I have installed. Casting works okay, but during playback the connection to the Chromecast is dropped, leaving the content playing, but now with no controls to pause, rewind, etc. Also fun is how the app stops responding after switching away and back again. The best part, though? Sometimes the app ghosts when I switch to it, showing no UI, and the switch app button becomes unresponsive. I'm running a Pixel on Android 14. This is the only app behaving this way; D+ for D+.",2024-04-22 05:40:26,1
"The content is fine, but the TV app has a TERRIBLE audio issue. Not everyone has a surround sound system! myThere should be an option to select an ordinary stereo mix! I KNOW it exists, because sound is perfectly fine on a mobile device (e.g. with headphones). But on TV, it is almost impossible to watch movies because dialogue is incredibly soft and, even worse, has a constant hollow phasing/flanger sound throughout. Please fix the audio settings, Disney!",2024-04-12 06:46:05,2
"I love watching this (& Hulu)! I also appreciate such options as small but clear closed captions & the option to rewind 10 seconds at a time to catch details I'd missed (HBO Max take note! After their recent changes, closed captions in large type over black boxes cover the picture all around the screen making films unwatchable with it!) It is frustrating, however, when ads pop up even in the middle of a really brief short! Funds are too tight for me to spring for the ad-free option.",2024-03-01 00:30:30,4
I have enjoyed the app for the past few years but since time to renew my subscription I have been experiencing a glitch. I wanted to change from yearly to monthly but I have not been successful. When I go to the app and press update payment the screen starts refreshing and just keeps trying to refresh over and over and over again until I leave the site. Please fix this so I can renew my subscription and get back to watching my favorite shows.,2024-03-29 20:27:42,2
"Update: reinstalled recently and it seems to work ok now. Increased from 1 to 4 stars. Previous review, May 2023: Worked great for a year or so. The past couple of months this app has become unusable. It often stalls out before I can even select a profile, usually won't accept my pin for my profile, and on the rare occasion that I can get signed in I can't watch anything, even downloaded content. Streaming on tv and roku seem fine, but android app is essentially non-functional.",2024-03-10 22:32:20,4
"Literally the worst app on my phone and tv. Will not stay signed in for more than 1 day. Forgets account information all the time. Tv prompts me to enter an 8 digit pass code every time the app starts. The link on the app takes you to a log in page, not a place to type in the code. It's no wonder this service is being canceled in mass. If the process to watch a single episode of a show is logging into an app on the TV, an app on the phone, checking an email, the the service will die.",2024-02-25 23:23:38,1
"I thought my issue has been fixed, but it hasn't. The horror section only shows 30 titles which is not the full catalog of horror titles on Hulu. When I search for horror titles by selecting movie and then click on the genre horror, I get a full list but I can't look at it because scrolling past the 18th row causes the list to roll right back to the top. Couple all of this with the fact that I can't tell Disney+ what I don't want to see and it makes me want to keep Hulu since it works better.",2024-04-01 13:05:51,1
"Not sure where to leave a review for the firetv version, so I'm doing it here. This app (the ad version) is the worst thing ever. Cannot even get through half of a movie. It freezes at just about every ad break. Have to completely exit and restart the movie and maybe, if you're lucky, it will resume where you left off at.",2024-03-16 22:31:29,1
"the content is great, but the Android TV version of the app is completely horrible. I have been trying to watch something several times over the past several months, and it has been getting progressively worse. I started title, and without fail somewhere along the lines I have to restart playback because for some reason the Disney app just decides I don't need to see this and goes back to the previous screen. I have quite literally sat here the past 20 minutes trying to watch the last two mins.",2024-03-08 23:49:18,2
"This app has been extremely glitchy lately making it almost unusable. It closes regularly and will not save your spot where it stopped. Even if you know where you left off, it's hard to get back there the way the app is designed. Hopefully they fix it soon. Update: Several months later and even a new phone and the problem still persists.",2024-04-01 07:05:15,1
"There's no button to start over from the beginning (there's only one on a Roku if you pay for a higher tier). You sometimes have to get through one round of ads by starting from where you left off days or weeks earlier, and from there slide the play head to the beginning, and then more ads start playing. Some of the same content is on official YouTube channels where it's faster and easier to access, and seek/scan though without as many ads. It seems like the experience could be improved easily.",2024-03-27 17:22:23,1
"Its not terrible, but it could be better. There's no organizing your watch list. no mini player. The progress bar is too close to the edge of the screen so pulling up device menus often accidentally skips you around your movie. Not everything is available year round. Some lag problems, and doesn't always retain my spot in a show or movie. (Edit 4/24) Watchlist no longer displays more than a certain number of the most recent additions to it",2024-04-14 12:42:59,2
"For some reason, whenever I try to cast a show to my TV, it will play the content just fine, vut will cause my phone to bug out, with the screen constantly flashing until I reboot my device. Even when rebooting, the content remains streaming, and I can't think of a single reason why a streaming service of all things could cause this, especially since it was working fine last Thursday.",2024-04-08 23:56:02,1
"Horrible UX. Have to click through multiple screens repeatedly to skip to the next episode. What engineer forgot the ""next"" button? seeking jumps all over the place & often starts the episode over. Even gets stuck on an episode from time to time & starts looping. Extremely buggy & is the only app out of 6 I use which has problems with Chrome cast. All around poorly built app.",2024-03-06 04:01:10,1
"You would think, with how big of a brand Disney is, that their streaming services would be one of the better ones, right? NO! Because apparently, for whatever reason, it would seem that this app will only crash. I loved it at first. I didn't have any issues, but then it crashed and won't play any of the movies or shows, I'll GLADLY change this to a five-star if it gets fixed.😐",2024-04-06 05:16:55,2
"Starts the movie over if you happen to pause and come back later, and doesn't have an option to skip credits at end... I feel like VCR's are literally better than this app. Also super slow to load, especially when hitting the back/forward 10 seconds buttons. You would think Disney would have their act together.",2024-04-09 04:57:05,2
"This app is not worth getting on Chrome. It is good with movies and things, but a problem I have currently is updating it. Whenever I hit update in the app it brings me back to my homescreen, so I have to go the playstore and search up Disney+. Then when I hit update and after an hour of waiting I come back and nothing has changed. It didn't update at all. At first I thought that I could just keep watching, but nope I HAVE to update it to continue using Disney+. So I can't watch anything, im sad",2024-03-30 16:11:54,3
"5.1 and Dolby Atmos audio has been broken for almost a year now. Everything plays in stereo only. There have been no updates from Disney on ETA for fix, or if they are even going to fix. Update 4/8/24 - App was updated to a newer version with release notes stating they've made bug fixes and updates. 5.1 and Dolby Atmos audio still not working on my Sony TV. Cancelling subscription, never giving business again.",2024-04-09 01:28:24,1
"It hasn't worked in 6 months, and everyone's excuse is that it's my internet, but it's funny because I have, Max, Peacock, and a couple other major streaming apps I use daily and they've never failed once!! While I've been paying for service and not being able to use it!! While I'd like to keep Disney, I feel I should be reimbursed for the last 6 months, I can't afford to pay for something that NEVER works.",2024-04-06 17:09:20,1
"I already canceled my subscription because the price was too high, and I just got an email stating it's going up another $30. Definitely glad I cancelled. I only watch Star Wars content so it's just not worth it anymore. With the amount I've spent on my subscription for the past couple years I could have just purchased all the seasons of every Star Wars show. Also, the user interface needs work.",2024-04-12 00:25:57,3
every time I click on the app it will show the Disney symbol for a couple of seconds and then it goes back to my home screen. I've tried uninstalling updates and and reinstalling but the app will not open. it works on my other TVs but not on my most recently purchased smart Google TV from Sony which defeats the whole purpose of me buying a nicer TV with Disney plus but this is supposed work but for some reason the app is cutting itself off,2024-03-22 14:47:24,1
"All I want is to download videos to watch offline, but no wifi I have tried is apparently strong enought for this app to download. I keep gettinf error code 83. Sometimes if I keep retrying 100 times in a row, it'll start downloading but it might not finish downloading. Sometimes the wifi is strong enough to stream, but not to download still. I can download fine on Netflix and other apps, so this is obviously a Disney+ problem. Restarting, uninstalling, logging out/in, & updating doesn't fix it",2024-03-27 11:26:42,1
App is broken. It was working fine but for the last several days when you try to play an episode of a show it gets stuck on the same episode and won't let you play a different one. Downloading the content results in an error about it not being available in my region even though it is. I can't leave feedback in the app since that causes an error also.,2024-03-24 06:25:22,1
"Update It does work much better now. But I still often have issued if I download a show and try to watch it offline, there's a 50/50 shot it won't work Unable to connect. It's great when it works but everytime I open it, especially on my tablet, it is unable to play. Lousy",2024-04-17 13:23:29,4
"Download speeds are incredibly slow. 121 MB episode that is 21 minutes long taking over an hour to download, while full movies that are over 1.5 GB are downloading within a half hour on Netflix on the same device. Additionally the app keeps insisting I need wifi to download, even though I've turned off ""WiFi only downloads"" in the settings on both the app and my phone. Otherwise decent service with a lot of selections.",2024-04-04 16:38:46,3
"Don't bother w/basic plan You will be absolutely tortured w/commercials - too frequent, too long. When you try to rewind or fast forward, this cues more commercials to play. I can't even backtrack w/out seeing a commercial. I tried to upgrade to stop commercials. Upgrade won't start for a month Will see if I can find out how to cancel subscription & restart w/out commerciaks if I can Most people won't tolerate onslaught of commercials so I wonder how they get advertisers",2024-03-20 05:41:38,1
I enjoy the service. It has everything I like to watch. The amount of ads are ridiculous nowadays though. Also when I pause to take a break it ends up either kicking me back a episode or stating it over and in order to fast forward to where I was I have to watch more ads that I already watched the 1st time playing the episode. 3 stars till something changes,2024-03-25 20:55:00,3
"App is currently horrible. It won't even allow fully load without automatically closing out. The phone app for Disney+ is already updated yet still errors. Cache is cleared for it also & no luck opening. Until they get this fixed, I, with a heavy heart, say it's not worth the money if you can't even use it. I hope they let everyone know one's it's fixed & make it a priority to fix.",2024-03-25 03:23:52,1
"The Disney+ app keeps indicating an update is needed to proceed with using the app; however, on my TV, it will not allow us to select Update, and on my phone, when I select Update, it takes me to the App store where there is no option to update the app. The only options are to Open or Uninstall. When I select Open, it takes me back to the screen that indicates an update is needed. Uninstall is starting to look appealing, as well as canceling my subscription, if this doesn't get rectified soon.",2024-04-17 22:57:54,2
"After 3 seconds of opening, it freezes. Don't know why, but it freezes, without fail. Closed and reopened about 15 times now. Restarted my device. But nope, it still freezes. Never had this issue before, I like the selection of shows and movkws but that doesn't really matter if I can't access it. For a multibillion dollar company you'd think they'd spend more than a penny on their app",2024-02-11 18:47:36,1
"After I finish a series, it just stays in the ""Continue Watching"" menu. It is across all devices, so it is not a cache issue. I have let them run every episode to completion; still there. Also, there is no way to edit continue watching. How can a company with the money Disney has make such a poor app? Disney should have the best player out there, but instead it lacks even basic features.",2024-02-11 06:57:17,1
"Not a good product or streaming service. They make you think that because it's Disney every Disney movie ever made will be available. 100% a lie. Disney refuses to allow you to watch everything Disney. If you sucker yourself into paying for this, under no circumstance should you fast forward or rewind any episode or movie. This is where the second rate quality of the app really comes into effect. Any attempt to fast forward or rewind, ANYTHING, will result in the app crashing.",2024-03-17 05:25:34,1
"This is by far the absolute worst viewing media app ever. It never loads and my internet will play every app I have. But Disney always says they're having issues. Yes, I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice. Same thing. My other apps work great. Disney bundle is awful. And... I've spent the last 2 hours trying to cancel and it's freaking impossible!!!",2024-02-12 23:58:49,1
"There are some very good movies and shows on this app. I really liked it and gave 5 stars at first until they took away the group watch, added more ads that can't be skipped & the ads are replayed if you have to rewind because said ads interrupted an otherwise great scene. Unfortunately it seems this app is becoming the same as alot of these other run of the mill streaming apps. Hopefully they'll be able to make viewing a more enjoyable pleasure like it once was before.",2024-03-20 01:27:08,2
"2 stars for good content. But I have a lot of subscriptions for my shows and this is the 2nd worst one. Glitch, freezes up constantly. And no small screen option. I like to listen to my shows while doing other things, not possible with this app. Really hope they make a few changes, I'd love to be able to change my rating. Edit: worse now. No cast to screen. If you want to rewatch an episode it starts at the credits. No rewatch option, you have to rewind the whole episode by 10 second intervals",2023-11-16 18:48:36,2
"this gives me access to the movies and series that I'm interested in, there's even extras like cut scenes and trailers. the app doesn't seem to cache anything. if you miss something and go back 10 seconds, it has to load everything again, if you have a slow Internet connection you could miss it again. I've had to turn on subtitles just to read what was interrupted by buffering.",2023-12-13 18:39:58,4
"1. Plays ads even if you have the ad-free version for the subscription which costs more. 2. Used to be lag free as far as selecting and starting shows and movies, now there's a significant lag and various pauses each time you try to do that. 3. Never stops asking who's watching, even in the same session, with the same account, on the same device, on the same network. 4. Using the Disney Plus app as a login for other devices doesn't work, so you still have to enter your password manually.",2023-11-25 06:32:44,1
"Absolutely the most frustrating streaming app I have used. UI is fine, the issue is every 10-15 days the app will log you out and not recognize your saved password. Even if you enter the correct password it will still tell you it is wrong. The only way to log back in is going through a password reset every single time. Looking at the help forums, this is apparently an ongoing issue for years and has yet to be addressed. Happy to change my rating once this is addressed.",2023-11-09 16:17:20,1
"I just got the app, and it worked for about an hour or so. Then, after downloading the next episode of a show and finishing the current one, it completely bricked. Now, every time i start up the app, it just shows the menu on the bottom and a loading symbol that doesn't go away. Restarting the app, switching to data, and restarting my phone, none of them have worked. So thank you, Disney, for not only delivering mostly sub-par originals but also for delivering a sub-par app. Disney magic indeed",2023-12-01 15:18:49,1
"Without ads it's smooth and easy to navigate. With ads (did their black Friday deal) it's trash. The ads freeze up, so you have to back out, goes back about 30 seconds, then tries ads again and freezes again. Repeat this about 5 times before you can clear ads and get back to your show or movie. Just trash. I only resubscribed for the deal, but really not worth it. If it doesn't resolve by the end of my month, I'm out. I'll just use my YouTube live recordings and fast forward. Through the movies",2023-11-29 21:33:41,3
"This app worked fine for a long time until a few weeks ago. I'm not sure what happened, but now everything just spins and doesn't play. Tried shutting down the app, uninstalled and reinstalled, and had no change. It tells me my internet connection is bad, but other streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Prime all work fine. Emailed the developer for assistance with no reply. I'd like to cancel, but it's a bundle package.",2023-11-28 09:56:12,1
"Horrible time logging in. I don't use Disney plus on my phone often, but when I do, I have to reset my password every single time because it says my password is incorrect. It's absolutely a mess. I have called support multiple times and they say there are no one but my devices connected to it. No recent password changes (except the ones I make when logging in on my phone). It's unusable on my phone. On my computer, TV, and XBox I NEVER have these issues. I can log in with NO problems.",2023-12-08 05:25:38,1
"This app is the most garbage app of all of the streaming services. It just stops working when you cast something, leave the app, and come back. The skip button often doesn't work. If you hit fast forward or rewind too quickly everything just freezes up. I swear I've seen the spinner on this app (unresponsive) more often than not. Just throw it away and reskin the Hulu app (though that one is pretty awful too).",2023-12-08 03:19:20,1
"Imagine having a differentiating feature like Group Watch that stands you out from the competition, and then silently removing it without even any warning or notice. It was something that was relatively simple to implement, yet hugely beneficial to people especially when you were away from friends and loved ones. I always enjoyed being able to watch things with my partner while having a video call going when we weren't physically together.",2023-12-07 05:33:21,1
"Seems like they're never going to fix the issue. The app will take forever to open, freeze spontaneously, and then the app will completely close. Every. Single. Time. I'm extremely lucky to get a whole movie without it closing. This is the 4th time in a row for ONE MOVIE I've been trying to watch. Don't waste your money on the subscription. You're better off just buying the movie so it works when you want it.",2024-01-15 02:23:11,1
"This app sucks on mobile. I can't watch a single movie without hearing this message every single time: ""There seems to be an issue connecting to the Disney+ service."" This same error has been unfixed for MONTHS now. I tried restarting my phone, reinstalling Disney+, updating my phone, clearing the cache on the Disney+ app, and nothing worked. I was not having this issue on TV, PC, ect. If you can fix this issue. I will be very pleased. Thank you.",2023-11-24 18:51:49,1
Edit 3yr: it's worse Something is wrong with the way their system is coded. I have had this issue on my old IPhone 12 and my new Galaxy S Ultra 22 so clearly it is not the system the app is download onto. It won't matter how strong my internet connection is there are times when it's almost like the movie itself is still being uploaded to the server while I'm watching. Every few seconds it has to stop to load and even if you pause to give it time the movie will still refuse to play smoothly.,2024-02-15 02:02:19,1
"For what Disney charges you would think they could solve their playback issues. No matter what I am trying to watch, if it's on Disney +, it's going to spontaneously stop multiple times throughout the episode or movie. This does not happen with any other streaming app. It's not my internet. Last July we moved across the country and got a new provider. Same issues with Disney +. It's honestly really disappointing. We wait and wait for something to come out, only to not be able to watch fully.",2024-01-10 02:16:19,2
It glitches a lot. There is a lot of buffering. A lot of shows are really dark. I'm constantly having to turn up the brightness on my phone. Unfortunately I get a rude reminder that my phone brightness is way to bright when I switch to other streaming service or go to use my cell. You can't minimize this app and continue watching it while completing other tasks. Even free apps like tubi have this feature. Very disappointed in this app.,2023-11-29 06:34:10,1
"I know that there is good content here, I just wish it was easier to access. The app never loads properly, can't search, and all of the tiles don't show up correctly. Updated to only 2 stars because the above has been fixed but the app on Roku has been having an issue with playback for months now. When the next episode of something plays you can hear the audio but get no video.",2024-01-21 15:52:36,2
I canceled my subscription through my Google account and 2 months later I found that I was still being charged monthly despite having a yearly membership until that point. Then I tried to cancel on the app and it makes you go to a web page and you have to navigate to cancel. They make it super easy to change your plan but they hide where to cancel it. 2 months of being charged unknowingly was 54 dollars. Absurd price.,2024-01-28 18:31:18,1
"Still not great a year later. I wish just one app or service would be in working condition BEFORE charging a subscription for this hard to access content. I mean the download season button STILL doesn't work right. And it ignores everything if there's more than 20 episodes. How can it take years to fix such a simple bug?? Constant download errors plague my Star Wars addiction. ""Searching"" for shows while downloading crashes the app. You know, cause it's still brand new I guess..",2023-11-21 12:50:42,1
"This is a terrible mobile app that works horribly with Chromecast. It struggles to connect, struggles to stay connected, struggles to find where I left off when watching a series, etc. With Hulu coming to Disney+, I can only imagine the problem getting worse. Hulu is a good app. I'd rather Disney+ content going over there instead of vice versa. I like both platforms, but really do not like the Disney+ app.",2023-12-27 23:28:36,2
"Solid content, and I like that there are no ads, but I have so many problems with streaming from the app: it loses my place in films and series, sometimes skipping ahead and sometimes resetting to a previous point.

"Poor. Always freezes when I cast, takes me about 3 goes. It is hard trying to skip an episode of something, makes it hard work, and then doesn't play the one you want, you're better off fast forwarding to the end to get to the next episode. Then the screen goes black at the start of the episode with error message! The amount of money disney has behind them and this is what happens.",2024-04-24 13:08:05,2
"1. Highly annoying you can no longer remove shows from ""continue watching"" 2. When opening an episode it takes at least a minute to load. 3. The sound, when playing from TV, is unreliable. Background sounds are randomly loud en voices can sometimes hardly be heard. 4. When you want to skip forwards or backwards it immediately causes the whole episode to lag or crash. 5. In shows that aren't spoken in English (like Shogun) half of the subtitles are missing or coming in late...",2024-04-24 21:05:22,1
App runs very poorly on my android when using chromecast. Frequent error codes. Movies and tv-shows never continue from where I left off from. Basic version plays ads at beginning of a show and if I skip forward or backwards. This results in multiple ads when trying to find where I left off from. The most recent time I encountered this problem resulted in 8-9 minutes of ads. I'll most likely cancel subscription. Ad version does not work well with broken app.,2024-04-21 22:30:00,1
Terrible app. Wont save progress on a movie or show let alone where we are up to on a series. No fine selection on the timebar so when the app crashes you have guess the time you were up to in a movie. This leads to jumping around and ultimately accepting you will be rewatching for 10mins to catch up. No Stop button on shows. Because the app does not save which episode your up to you have to disconnect Chromecast to change to a different episode. Chromecast is glitchy overall. Was better in 2020,2024-04-25 08:56:53,1
"Since Disney+ stopped working via screen mirroring from my phone to my older smart tv, I just haven't been able to watch any movies with my young kid.. At this point I just can't justify paying for a subscription I can't do anything with :( watching the classics on a tiny phone screen just isn't cutting it. Any workarounds just cost more money next to the subscription cost, it just makes trying incredibly frustrating. My TV is apparently too old to support the Disney+ app.. Sadness.",2024-04-22 22:25:52,1
Having issues with watching trailers to the point I've had to go to YouTube instead because they won't play on the app. Prior to the most recent update we had occasional issues with some trailers playing in French with no option to play in English despite being a major Disney film. After the most recent update it just won't play them at all. It brings up the black screen and spinning circle and then closes it immediately. Tried in the extras section too and the same thing happens.,2024-04-19 23:25:17,3
"Catalog is ok but the app in itself is really bad, it does not remember where you paused, fast forward or backward is bad and you don't see the timing when trying to do it by hand so more or less you're lucky to land around 10 min from where you were... But hey at least you have a new logo and a really loud welcome sound",2024-04-24 17:59:53,2
"About half of the time it's fine. However the app often fails to load content, just displaying a generic error message. Casting to Chromecast takes multiple attempts before it actually works. When you try to cast downloaded content, you get a message saying the content isn't available in your region - you have to delete it to get it to cast. A pretty unreliable app.",2024-04-18 20:06:08,2
"Firstly, let me start off by saying the content Disney+ offers is superb! It is my favourite app for watching all my favourite programmes such as Star Wars, Marvel and Disney/Pixar. However, the main problem I have with the app, is the downloads. Even though I download movies and series to my phone storage, I regularly encounter issues trying to watch the content offline. This either requires me to restart the app/phone, or to delete the content and redownload it at a later date.",2024-04-17 17:38:42,3
"Has some decent shows but the app can be glitchey. If you stop a show half way through, when you try to continue later on it restarts at the start of the episode instead of where you left off. And when trying to skip to the spot you need the app freezes up again making it hard to find the right spot.",2024-04-24 09:03:01,2
Can't fault it for content but downloads are an issue. Can't download a thing on my phone despite plenty of space both internal and external. My old S8 can download episodes with no problem. Back from holidays and now upgraded latest app and now can't play downloads on other usable devices so had to delete. Now various errors across all devices including one on the iPad asking me to connect to the internet as my content expired and failed to renew content licence (after just downloading it)!,2024-04-24 14:29:38,3
"It has a lot of room for improvement. I. Here because I'm a fan but this app can be frustrating sometimes. From not having the option to go to the next episode from the phone app (on the desktop it doest), to being slow to load, not quickly switching to a new show as a press play ( I had to disconnect and cast again to be able to change show half way through). I have to say that Netflix is so smooth by comparison. Disney is a big company. Do better!",2024-04-17 03:14:46,3

"I've never had so much trouble using streaming apps as much as this one. It's the worst! I'm always having connectivity issues (with this app), it takes at least one minute into an episode before it finishes buffering and starts to play smoothly, and when I want to skip ahead or go back, it takes so long to buffer again! I rarely post reviews, but I've been using and dealing with this app long enough to warrant a poor review.",2024-04-13 23:55:03,1
"The worst streaming app I've ever used. Constantly freezing, glitching and closing. You can't rewind, it continues to play while it's loading to rewind, and you end up in the same place or it freezes completely. Playback jumps around, you end up in different spots or even different episodes. Shows disappear from ""Continue to watch."" Just awful. So slow in every aspect. Forever crashing.",2024-04-03 14:30:36,1
"Content is great, but the app is really bad. Things you can't do: skip intro, skip to the next episode.

"The app is a buggy mess, half the time when you start a video, it says an error occurred and you have to restart the video. Chromecast freezes when you cast unless you cast the video after it's started playing. This doesn't happen in any other streaming service. Same bugs on all phones in the household. 2024 edit: now changing episodes while casting is also broken while none of the old bugs have been fixed.",2024-03-29 13:39:53,1
"Only got the extra star because I enjoy the content. The app itself is glitchy, regularly drops out and then when you reconnect it and try to resume the episode starts from the beginning instead of where you left off... on my Tab A it also regularly freezes needing restarts. Also, unlike other apps it doesn't have the feature to pause playing after a certain amount of episodes to see if you're still watching which can result in this being a time suck. Not my preferred app at all.",2024-04-16 06:20:56,2
Really frustrating the amount of clutter that ends up in Continue Watching that you can't easily remove. Films you can skip to the end and let the last several seconds play out and it will be gone. Doing the same with shows puts the next episode into Continue Watching. It needs an option to allow you to remove things from Continue Watching.,2024-04-19 10:25:49,2
"The content is great but the app has a lot of bugs room for improvement. Navigating in the app is very slow. The app start-up is even slower. Offline handling is not good. Downloading takes too long. Downloads disappeared several times, then had duplicates(?). I lose my progress regularly; the video just starts from the beginning. Screen gets dimmed on low light and no shortcut to adjust. These are just the actual problems I'm facing. There are also a bunch of things that just could be improved.",2024-03-16 10:04:09,1
"This is the worst app ever. It is glitchy, constantly quitting. Ridiculous. I expect much better from a company like Disney. Also, why not have a queue feature? If you have 7m shorts it would be nice to be able to string them together. Or playing collections as a playlist, like being able to watch all of the Treehouse of Horrors, for example, together instead of it going to the next ep in the season.",2024-03-14 23:32:11,2
"Some problems, A little too much to list , but the most common are the desyncs / disconnects from the device whole casting and a black screen with some sort of null error. Most aolveable by restarting the device. Simply restarting the app does not solve anything sadly. Bit of a inconvenience, restarting phone every time I need to interact, but it still works. Disney plus tends to bug out from time to time, self correcting within a few days. Hoping it's just having one of its ""moments""",2024-03-24 02:17:56,3
"I had no problems with the app until recently. When I fly somewhere and try to watch the downloads, the videos don't open! It requires Internet connection to start the video, even though it is downloaded. So if I open downloaded video with data on, and then disable it - all good. But if I want to open video mid flight, when I have no WiFi or data available, video just won't open for me. Useless app, as this is the only reason why I needed an app in the first place.",2024-03-24 16:50:27,1
"Hmmm. There are some good and bad things about the service. The good, well it has all the disney films and the old pre marvel stuff is class. The bad, there are not enough films added and worse of all, is the very limited watchlist. It was always a low limit but overnight this weekend, half the films on the list disappeared so I don't know what i can watch without spending hours trawling through. The only other way is to delete films of the list, which defies the purpose of having a list.",2024-03-24 20:09:24,2

Only complaint is the inability to adjust video quality when over Wi-Fi (mild inconvenience when on basic high speed Internet).

AD before the program and maybe once in the middle of the film But wow, tried to watch a TV series and there were ads at so many points, way more than watching regular TV, that I would rather not watch TV series programming if this is what you call acceptable...watching streams on free YouTube way more enjoyable. ..",2024-03-25 19:29:30,2
"As other reviewers have commented, content is amazing! But the app itself ... has a long way to go, both the TV and mobile, especially QOL stuff. To name a few:- - There's no way to remove a title from continue watching unless you forcibly skip it to the end. - Don't bother adding stuff to watchlist as it's incredibly tedious to remove it after. It's simpler just to save them as a note. - Subtitles can't be customised (size/color) so they just eventually become a distraction.",2024-03-28 23:44:00,2
What is the yellow exclamtion mark? Also idk what happened with the last couple updates. Now next episodes don't start until the ALL the credits have completely run and the episode or show ends. You have a ton of language credits. Plus now you can't select anything to play while something is playing unless you exit the app or skip to the end of the credits and the program ends. This never use to be an issue so please fix it. Also it is no longer registering watched episodes so i have to guess.,2024-04-17 08:55:44,1
"The app isn't as user-friendly as it should be considering how much Disney is charging for subscriptions now. Also, how is it my downloaded movies need to buffer?

"Disney itself is swell; we love a lot of the shows. This app kinda sucks, though. It often has errors that cause it to pause or stop playing, or give you the blue wheel of death. It will randomly decide you must restart your watching from the same episode one season back for three days straight. It'll decide the specific show you'd like to watch is impossible to stream. If you use it on google cast, expect it to randomly disconnect. Of all the streaming platforms we use, this one is the worst.",2024-02-28 23:45:56,2

You already know what's the problem, pass them to the developer team! Thanks",2024-03-29 17:33:04,2
The app has a function allowing you to download shows to watch offline. But when I'm on the subway and don't have signal I can't watch any of those downloads because the app won't work unless it phones home first. Elementary incompetence or paranoia. Not sure which.

"Great content, shame they still lag years behind any other streaming app. Not all series have skip intro/recap buttons and the timer is way too long, no picture in picture support. Can't go onto a series from recently watched and choose an episode, you have to play from wherever you were if you want to choose an episode, you need to manually search for the series and then go all the way through the ep list to get to where you were - other competing services have none of these issues at all",2024-04-08 08:49:01,2

the content is fine but the app itself has flaws. using the twins buttons have terrible loading times or fails to load completely. a nice QOL feature would be to preview where you are in the show while scrolling the show runtime.

"One of the worst streaming apps out there, second only to the ITVX app for sheer ""unusability"". Never removes completed films from ""continue watching"" unless you literally watch every second of the end credits. Constantly loses new films being watched, probably because the ""continue watching"" list is so choked up. Rolls back up to 10 mins when you start watching again, loses connection to the streaming device every time so you can only stop streaming by turning off the TV. Truly awful",2024-03-09 10:21:49,1

"While the app does a decent job showing content, it's not adept at showing offline content. I'm sure that in some circumstances it can show content that was downloaded for offline viewing, but not any time I've tried to use it. The app insisted on needing a connection which it wasn't going to get as I was on a long haul flight over the Atlantic at the time. I wasn't about to pay the airline $20/£20 to let the app phone home so I could watch content I'd downloaded only four hours before.",2024-03-23 13:07:02,3
"Really bad if you have with ads. As soon as an ad starts, there is a problem. Either the ad doesn't even play, and you can't fast forward past it. The only thing to do is to stop playing and start it again. Or it doesn't start playing at all until you have started and stopped the playback a few times. Sometimes, you even have to reboot the app altogether. Is really annoying, but maybe you get what you are paying for.",2024-03-31 02:58:00,1
"Very buggy and slow app from start to finish. If I select a profile with a PIN, it will reject my input as ""Wrong PIN"" for 2-3 times until it accepts it on the 4th try (I input the same PIN everytime). On playing something, plenty of times it does nothing but display the busy cursor for a significant amount of time. I have to force stop and clear cache to make it work. Most streaming apps have excellent UI. Disney+ should learn a thing or two from Netflix and Prime",2024-03-11 23:30:08,1

Well worth it. Oh, I pay for the tier without ads. Given how much I'm getting to watch and how often I do.. yes, it's acceptable. I hope it doesn't go up again though.

There's plenty of alternatives that are cheaper or free.",2024-03-24 05:11:45,3
"For the price of the service (and the constant increasing charges) this app is garbage. It has been getting increasingly worse while casting, buffering and just connecting in general. Update: was holding out hope for the update. Instead the app now won't let me switch episodes on the same show.

One of the truly worst pieces of software I've had the displeasure of using. Audio & video constantly stutters and resumes out of sync. Crashes randomly. Slow to load the end-credit graphics and freezes when moving to the next episode. I've unsubscribed from this purely because of the app. It's a first world problem but I'm not paying for the privilege of this terrible service. Half of half of half a star.,2024-03-07 18:29:03,1
The app works well enough much like most online streaming services though keep an eye on it for some reason the price will increase almost double and it does not show in your online account only on the payment service you use and can come as a shock if you see on the disney site $8.99 and google says $14.99 theres also an extortion plan as well like the others where you pay for a service then pay more for no ads. not a fan of that so time to trim the fat as it were,2024-03-31 00:05:58,3

You suck stop trying to be the next cable company that's what it is if you pay the cheaper fee for the ads it reminds me of cable TV before streaming was a thing that's why they partner with Hulu and ESPN they're trying to make streaming into the new cable I get one maybe two ads before the show starts on max and Disney puts several ads throughout the entire show?!!

Broken app. The only decent thing about it is the catalogue of content but the app itself isn't capable for it. Frequently deletes downloads even if you just downloaded them.

With the integration of both we constantly have to screen the suggested shows before allowing our kids access to the app. You cannot ""remove from list"" for suggestions that we do *not* want for us or for kids.

My favourite streaming service for on the go and out and about both family and single trips. Works well in good WiFi environments. Despite been different and an objective running on Xperia the Sony Bravia app auto boosts screen brightness for optimum HDR on the 4k screen while the software adjusts the rest.

Each update has awful glitches and breaking bugs. We have to untether our phone to our Chromecast just to change shows or episodes and a majority of shows will not stream due to errors. I feel that this has been a reoccurring for the past six months. Whatever rebasing they did for their code base for this app really borked something.,2024-04-06 13:26:50,1
"Doesn't allow you to remove unfinished series/films from Continue Watching section, you have to move them to the end of the shows/film, so it gets the recommendations totally wrong.

"like all software based things, theres a few bugs here and there, but otherwise it works, Def not 5 or 4 or 3 stars tho just because the amount of times i have to change the volume between shows and movies, close and reopen app to get the lil warnings in the top to go away or i just give up and watch through it 🤷‍♂️ I stopped caring about the software issues love ya disney, (but add a reporting system on the app)",2024-03-01 15:56:19,5

Suddenly stopped being able to log in on my WiFi. Nothing wrong with the WiFi but was able to log via my mobile tethered to the TV. Once logged in I can watch on the WiFi. This happened on every device suddenly. Again WiFi is fine for everything else and at 400mb speed. 1 star review until it's sorted because it shouldn't be this way and only because I'm a bit tech savvy that I found a workaround.,2024-02-29 07:59:42,1
Good selection of programs and movies but my gosh I am sick and tired of using the app. It never keeps up with what episodes you're on - the continue watching list is so far behind. Get on board with Netflix being able to go straight to the next episode too. Thanks.,2024-03-12 19:51:34,2
"Frustrating User experience with season episode lists. for the love of god, please make it easier and less buggy trying to browse the episode list for a tv series while playing.

I don't care to to the 2 in one. I open Disney and see Freaknik on as a suggestion!! Let Disney be Disney and Hulu be Hulu. In addition to that, my subscription has increased 50%. I'll just have to go back to Xfinity at the point.",2024-04-16 13:12:05,1

Everytime our family needs to reauthenticate (which is very often in a house with multiple TVs and users), it's required to reset your password.

It's to the point where every week we want to watch something on Disney+, we have to hop through 10 minutes of credential testing and resetting, to the point where we generally just cancel for a few months.",2024-04-09 14:31:03,1
It's a great app if your won't to watch good movies but the reason am giving it 2 stars is because when your watching a series after every episode there's an add its just really anoying and the adds are literally adds about buying Disney when your watching a movie or a series on disney its just so stupid I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have a add about disney after every episode when watching a series netflix says they have adds and I've only ever seen an add on there once please fix this.,2024-04-14 17:05:26,2
"It does the job but the app the terrible compare to Netflix. When you cast you can't see which episode you are at. It keeps lagging. I can't easily find the previous shows i was watching .... Omg this app is just f annoying. Update: the more i use this app the more i hate it 😂 connection phone-Google Chrome is awful, keeps going back to the episode i have watched already.... Ugh we are unsubscribing after that one show we want to watch 😂 it keeps saying ""there was an error while casting""",2024-03-06 01:12:58,1
Used to work fine on all my devices but not anymore. Latest update can't be installed on my android tv device rendering the app useless. Opening the app just tells me to update it which isn't possible..... I used the app like last week on this device. Sad twist unfortunately. Works fine on my other devices tho.,2024-04-20 04:13:39,3
"Trying to watch older shows such as family guy and the good doctor reveals that there's several cut segments. The show gets near where a commercial break would have been and cuts the last 10-15 minutes from that section and just skips ahead to the next section. Characters in mid dialogue are cut off completely and major plot point reveals are skipped entirely. This is not entertaining, this is frustrating beyond words. Many key points are omitted and I'm left not even wanting to watch anymore.",2024-04-10 05:39:14,1
"I uploaded today, new to this, but didn't think much of the choices, literally bought for one movie ,then spent an hour looking at content and eventually found something not terrible but had already seen, and the quality, buffering and drop outs a fair bit for a new app, don't seem to have that problem with the other streaming services, exact same deal, let's say if Disneyland is anything like this, then it's not really worth going.",2024-03-20 13:02:44,2
"Lost yet another ☆ & I'll explain Y- the downloading experience sucks. U download episodes and IF it decides to work, they'll still expire so if you have bad internet and go out to a place with WIFI to download things for later, you might get hit with it needing the internet to verify ur account AGAIN despite the fact that it should be able to TELL when your account would expire (read: not anytime soon) Also it'll break if it detects an app update. I legit miss DVDs bro. Why do I pay for this??",2024-03-22 04:28:12,2
Great app but for some reason when I login to the app on my phone then the home page or any page doesn't load or will take a very long time and possibly at least the tiles for the titles will show eventually the images may load. Please fix this issue so we may continue to enjoy Disney content seamlessly. It's still not loading the home page or gets stuck trying to load any page then may or may not be successful.,2024-03-03 19:16:08,2
"pathetic. doesn't work, constantly buffers, glitches, lags. plenty of signal and all other streaming apps work fine so it's a fault with Disney. I even went through troubleshooting with one of their operators and that didn't solve the issue, they just kept trying to claim it was a device issue and pass the blame. absolutely pathetic",2024-03-15 10:28:36,1
"Freezes every time I try to rewind it more than 10 seconds... I'm paying over $100/yr for this... you'd think it would work better... plus, it went up like $30 for the year. it was $79.99/yr, and now it's $109.99/yr... I'm wondering if it's even worth it anymore 🤔 😑😒",2024-04-04 04:04:27,2

"Disney + is probably the worst performing streaming app I have... and I have a lot. Netflix, Paramount, Amazon, Peacock, YouTube, Starz and even the free ones like CW network and Pluto. It constantly crashes, won't load on phone or TV. Glitches out. Do not bother paying for it it's not worth it. I only have it because it's free with my Verizon account.",2024-04-09 00:48:29,1
"Terrible UI, and why are there so many movies/tv shows that are edited down? Like 50% of the time if you look at the runtime on wikipedia, then the run time in-app, it's always 5 to even 15 minutes shorter, and that's not counting credits. Why is Disney chopping up their shows and movies? I know some really old ones had insentient content removed like the centaurs in Fantasia, but even recent releases appear to have large chunks missing, and you can tell when watching because of audio pops.",2024-03-12 02:20:28,1
Sure it has movies but not worth it if they constantly pause and speed up to catch back up every 30 seconds. Tested and it's not the WiFi or the device as all other streamers are fine with both same device and WiFi. Better options in almost every way.,2024-03-01 18:45:57,2
"Disney has some awesome series, however, I don't think having one season of a series thats close to a decade old is in any way entertaining. Its like giving candy to a kid and then taking it away as soon as they've had a taste of it. I also don't find it easy to look for something to view given the different providers within the app. So for those reasons, I give it 3 stars.",2024-03-02 17:54:24,3
"You have multiple audio languages I can select from in your app, so why not have dialogue in English when I select it. Many items I might enjoy are often in Japanese or other languages I do not know. You can easily afford to have actors speak the dialogue in each language. Serial digital video has 16 audio channels with each video feed, you could so easily make use of them. They are synchronous with the video and would take up nearly no extra storage on your servers. So why don't you do it?",2024-03-04 18:03:06,1
"There's Always a problem with Disney plus it either. Won't let you sign in and you have to recreate a new password, which is a pain in the butt. Or English is always saying there's an era.

Have to wait at least 30 or more seconds for the episode to start, slow response from the homepage, search and downloads sections, just the blue circle going round and round, doesn't stop. Glitches and freezes up if I pause it for more than 15 seconds. It honestly gets worse and worse each time I restart the app, it's never been like this before. Idk what to do. I submitted a report...I'm so angry",2024-02-05 11:25:27,3

The latest update that Disney+ forced me to download is riddled with bugs. Please test your products before releasing them. I really enjoyed my Disney+ experience & would have gave it 5 stars if it wasn't for this latest update. My kids really love watching Bluey & there used to be a button to skip the intro & at the end of the episode was a countdown for the next episode to start before the 5 mins of credits in other languages. The latest update took away those features. Please bring them back!,2024-04-03 18:28:30,2
"Useless on AndroidTV. Super slow and laggy, while other streaming apps work just fine. Subtitles are out of sync, or just don`t appear at all. Or a different language appears than you selected.

the app is bad. casting glitches Out the app and or your phone. when casting you can't switch series without uncasting and recasting. on your phone whenever it's a darker lit series or movie you can not see. bathing without full open brightness. love the stuff on Disney but the app is the utmost worst,2024-04-10 15:53:29,1
OMG I'm not sure why I haven't tried Disney Plus. It's packed with all varieties of entertainment. From TV shows to reality and movies and also movie hits from some of my favorites old schools movie and TV shows I watched when I was a kid. The selections is endless. Disney Plus has everything I want when I was searching for a second service along side with my Max subscription. Now i stream more on Disney than others. Thanks Disney for this wonderful app and collection. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,2024-03-31 21:55:11,5

Please fix this",2024-04-12 12:24:27,2

there's so much variety on Disney plus I love all the options you can get the movies shows and more.if there was something negative about this app it would probably be that there are a lot of playback issues and glitches that I would love to be fixed.totally recommended one of the best movie streaming services I've ever had thank you,2024-04-10 07:43:00,4
"Great except that some video screens are completely black despite the film rolling. I dunno what's caused that, but it should be fixed, as the app is very expensive yet I'm looking at a black screen 🤷‍♀️ *update* I've now given it 1* as the price has increased considerably and it's ridiculous.

Just get the wheel of death on the loading screen and have updated app, and deleted and reinstalled on each device to no avail. Really not good enough to be offering up garbage like this in this day and age of digital content.

Automatic fps matching. This will cover both Android TV and Fire TV. On the fire TV it sticks to 1080p@60hz. I can set manual 2160p@24 or 25 but this needs to be added. Also use the Amazon api to so it will adjust to 4K as well. On the Chromecast with Google TV Android 12 Matching FPS would be nice. Join Apple and Netflix in FPS matching. This will make the experience much better.,2024-04-04 14:43:03,3
Disney+ is a pretty good streaming app and I haven't had problems using it before however been seeing ads on it when its supposed to be ad free. This sounds like what Amazon prime is pulling and right now there is a lawsuit about it so we will see how it goes. Review will change to 5 star when ads are removed from Disney+ again.,2024-04-03 09:27:17,2

Disney plus used to be so good with all the original shows and now it's so weird with gay things and pro nouns. Ypu guys do know kids watch this. I also don't like the ads one of the reasons I used to watch Disney plus is because they had no ads. It now makes you the same as every other channel. Just some things to think about. By the way I'm twelve and it's coming from mine and other people's perspective. Thank Disney for making my childhood great.,2024-04-02 12:23:51,4

"This Disney app is no longer kid friendly. I downloaded this app years ago because the movies were clean and kid friendly, and they aligned with my family values. Now many of the choices do not align with my values. Before, I chose Disney because I and my children could watch the old, clean movies that I loved as a child. I did not have to pay to view things that didn't fit my values. Now, the only reason that I still have this app is to see my favorite old movies and old Star Wars movies.",2024-04-05 01:52:10,3

"Something that has been watched, and attempts to be viewed again, will pick up at the end of the episode. So much so that we can't rewatch the first episode of some things because it will go straight to the next episode countdown. Great when my kids love to rewatch stuff and it goes through 5 episodes in 5 minutes because they all went straight to the end of the next episode.

I don't care if it's a child or adult account, there shouldn't be LIQUOR STORE commercials played during a child's rated G program. Do better Disney. App also forgets what you were watching or where in the show, so you have to sit through more commercials to find where you left off. If you rew a few seconds it makes you watch commercials before rewind and then after another 10 seconds of watching show",2024-04-07 17:34:07,1

I have a £1600 Sony Xperia 1 mkV that displays Natively at 4k 120fps. Has HDR full Dolby Atmos and Audio 360.

Not entirely family friendly. There is bias content rating for the screening or content blocking. What they rate as PG is not really always appropriate for PG.

Excessive ads. If you just saw 5 minutes worth of ads and you rewind they will make you watch another 5 minutes of ads. If you accidentally go over the mark.

Do not buy yearly subscription through app. When you do and cancel they will not prorate the remaining time left. Understand they do not refund a partial month. Disney will cancel then tell you to get remaining months refund from Google. Google will tell you to dispute through your credit card. The credit card will tell you that Disney's terms and conditions do not allow a refund if a 3rd party billed it. The Disney+app is considered 3rd party biller.

I have tried to uninstall and then install again but it does not work. Very disappointed!,2024-02-29 18:47:59,1
This app is amazing despite what others say I love it sometimes it'll stop and say your internet isn't working but I'll just re click on it and its fine who really cares I figured a way around so whatever. They never take things off. The only thing I would say is bad is I can't unadd anything from my continued watching and u could watch it for 0.2 seconds and they'd still add it to your continued watching I have to go to the very last ep of show to get it off other than that it's amazing!!,2024-02-26 18:10:27,4
"Feb 2024, 2 years later. Offline viewing still locked down like crazy. What's the point of offline mode and downloaded videos if you need to be online first for the app to verify whatever? Without going online it just keeps claiming error. Yeah ""error"". Really useful offline mode. PSA: If you're watching Legion for the first time, don't check the Details section . I was just looking for cast information, and the synopsis next to it spoils the whole plot.",2024-02-18 12:52:55,1

Disney plus makes it almost impossible to cancel subscription. It took a hour of going in circles with their instructions & 30 minutes in chat with the dumbest live agent ever. 20 min agent Kent asks if i want to cancel! What? Yes! He didn't know what a debit card was either. 25 min in he said I still might be charged again in 3 weeks. I said I would dispute it with my bank. Then he says I can use until billing cycle is complete as if it wasn't normal. At the end he granted to cancel autosub.,2024-02-20 21:44:03,1

I love this app but unless I'm watching on my tv it's useless now. Try to watch anything on my phone and it stops every few min to buffer or something. Makes it so you can't watch anything.

The movies are good but the fact that you can't download anything anymore is so messed up. What happened to no internet watch????

One of the worst streaming apps. Stopped being able to cast. Often crashes. Doesn't keep track of watched shows or remember where you are.,2024-04-22 21:15:06,1
"I really wish you would give parents more control over shows that they can watch. There are lots of movies and things that are ok for my kids to watch rated pg13 but there's a lot that are not. I wish I could pick and choose what is shown to my kids without taking the rating down for all the shows. It's worse now that you added Hulu to your app. It was fine before that, and I didn't worry about what my kids are watching. Now I have to montier 24/7. Please make a block available.",2024-04-20 18:48:40,1
The app won't even open. There's a Play store notification that there were bug fixes on 4/15/24. It is midday on 4/16/24 and the app has refused to open all morning. At least 6 tries. What garbage is this?,2024-04-16 18:49:30,1
"Combining with Hulu was the WORST decision ever. None of your favorites transfer over. UI is good awful. Now, my 4 and under children have to see American Horror Story when we turn on the app.",2024-04-20 23:12:11,1
"I wanted to restart my subscription, but there is no way to do that. The worst app I have ever used. Whenever. I try to log in and start to subscribe, it automatically direct me to the app saying 'you are not subscribing'. There is nothing I can do.",2024-04-23 11:30:45,1
"I love this app glad I subscribe it and now I can view it on my tablet , my cell phone and my ROKU TV. I have no negative comments about the app. It works great for me on my phone, TV and now on my tablet. All my control buttons carryout their function correctly. I am more than satisfied and I recommend it for It's family , child and grownups of all ages .",2024-04-20 21:53:09,5

Very annoying. If you download anything you can't stream it to the TV. Annoying when your kids watch the same show over and over and both options are handy.,2024-04-17 19:56:40,2
"Changing my review from 5 to 2 stars. Chrome casting has gotten horrible. Tons of bugs and glitches now. For a company that makes as much as Disney, there is no reason for the app to suck this bad.",2024-04-23 01:06:16,2
I thought Disney was fun on the TV but on my computer it's way better because I can have my show sitting here in the corner playing well I play my game at the same time so basically I'm watching my show and getting closer to beating my game so that's what's so great about it having on computer.,2024-04-21 13:53:08,5

"App is great but ofc, not supported on a lot of TVs. That's fine - bought a Chromecast, all gravy. But now the audio on the PHONE app is glitching super hard, especially with headphones! It pauses, skips, fast forwards, goes silent but worst of all, it does a static/hissing/white noise vibes. I don't know if it's a recent update but it started only recently - a few days ago. Meh. (And no, it isn't the headphones as they're perfect with all other apps)",2024-01-30 19:31:43,3
"Very poor interface and response. Downloads are organised randomly, a when clicking to watch a download there's often a black screen for a long period of time before the video loads. The app rarely remembers where you have watched to, so you have to scroll again through the vid if you come back to watch later. There's also no way to download more episodes from the page, you have to go to the main screen or use the search function. How hard is it to add a button that lets you see more episodes?",2023-11-03 22:03:40,2

"Bought the more expensive subscription to be able to download shows and watch offline when travelling. Now, I'm unable to even open the app and access the downloaded files from Asia. Worked with Netflix. Waste of money. Next time, I will use torrents.",2024-03-12 04:59:36,1

Disney movies use to be beautifully done it was gorgeous my kids don't watch the new stuff they want to dive opiniond in there face and cancel good cartoons like star, owl house, amphibian",2024-04-10 18:22:55,2

"Programming's great, although there's not a single Star Trek, I really can't fault it. One of few services to offer most of my Xmas movies, with ambients such as fireplace. Streaming is good, does it's thing, with little interruption. However UI is pretty basic compared to most, and for me, data use is probably a bit worse. Also the play next feature is glitchy and slow, and the notification bar features just don't work.",2024-01-15 07:32:56,3
"The service is alright but the UI is lacking compared to other streaming services. It lacks the ability to cast to Roku (only Chromecast), which is very annoying because Netflix does so flawlessly.",2024-03-29 11:33:08,3

"Disney+ Is the best way to watch the latest television shows and movies you can have all kinds of movies, there are disney princess, comedy, fantasy, pixar, marvel, and more when something comes out on the cinema it'll most likely come out on disney+ after a few weeks but that is only if it's a disney movie. Disney+ is most certainly recommended.",2024-04-18 17:17:29,5
"As an app Disney+ is fairly good. The app is reasonably quick and the video player used is better than a lot of apps, though you have to manage subtitle size through android settings as there are no in app settings for subtitles. My main criticisms are the app layout is too cramped with ⅔ of the screen wasted on preview images and only ⅓ for rows of content. Also, new content is added at a much slower rate than before, with a lot of content being removed, apparently to cut costs, despite the fact Disney are increasing the subscription fee.",2024-01-22 01:10:44,3
Does not sync across devices. Constantly loses where I am up to in a movie or TV show. Not as easy to navigate as other streaming apps.,2024-03-08 10:25:54,2

"The content is great and unique so 5 stars for that. But the app, mobile or TV, would be better off if the user interface interacted more smoothly. Things like incorrect skip timestamps on non-disney -owned content, forward/rewind steps are too large, slow load times between screens, 'Continue watching' rarely continues at the moment you paused it, no option to preview content with trailers, Continue watching section is too far below other sections I'm not interested in...the list goes on.",2024-01-05 12:08:38,4
"Honestly, I'm not surprised at Disney for its stunts. But removing group watch was enough, but to increase the price and the audacity of a paid ad experience is an absolute joke. Disney Plus best feature was its affordable pricing. Delivering 4K and HDR was phenomenal. it's not worth it anymore for £10.99 the 2nd price increase you have done. We are getting fewer features for a higher price! I'm cancelling my subscription!",2023-12-24 02:37:15,1
I had disney a couple years ago.. never works.. always loading forever then error.. I got rid of it and figured by now (2 years later it would work better)... I was wrong.. logged in and 2 minutes later I started a movie and back to same issues.. 🙄 waste of money.,2024-02-27 05:40:16,1
"Since I don't have a smart TV, I use Chromecast to cast movies on my TV. Disney plus app often fails to cast movies properly. In my experience, it's one of the worse streaming apps out there. For example, I cannot cast Pirates of The Caribbean as it says it's not available in my region. But if I watch from the phone it works (no VPN being used).",2023-10-31 19:39:56,1
"I'm absolutely annoyed of the app. From time to time, the app crashes when I'm in ""picture in picture mode"" (hope it's called that way... you probably know what I mean).

"The absolute worst streaming app available, ever. If you want to watch a 30 minute show, make sure you have an extra 15 minutes to spare as you will spend that time watching the videos buffer. Doesn't matter if you are on WiFi, 4g or 5g, the issue still persists and upon contacting for support, Disney+ don't seem to have a clue how to resolve it on any device. This issue persists on every single device I've used Disney+ on. Avoid the app unless you have time to burn.",2024-02-12 11:28:30,1
"Random popup ad which cannot be closed takes up most of the screen, but doesn't stretch to fill the aspect ratio, so you only get part of the ad zoomed in, but not the button to close the ad. This also disables task manager, pause and close video functions while the ad (which cannot be closed) is open. So you need to lock the phone, unlock it with the camera shortcut, then open task manager to try again.",2024-02-13 10:07:28,1
Constantly just shuts down in the middle of a show. Now I can't rewatch an episode I want. I select it and it snaps me to the latest episode. I'm so done with this BS. I absolutely hate this app. DO BETTER,2024-04-17 17:55:55,1
"Not on par with functionality from other streaming apps. However, biggest issue for me personally is 4:3 shows like early seasons of Simpsons cut and cropped to fit in 16:9, missing a lot of great detail/context. It would be better to keep 4:3 and show pillar boxes. It's been raised by many since Disney+ was launched in 2020, but no movement on fixing it.",2024-03-23 12:08:28,1
"It is infuriating that the app does not remember where you are watching if using Chromecast. This used to work, but some time ago for broken. Now you always need to ""watch"" the program to correct time with phone after watching with Chromecast in order be able to continue next time. Using the forward and backward jumps with Chromecast don't work at all, so this makes it even more difficult to continue watching.",2024-02-11 18:38:48,3

"App is suddenly auto playing next episode!!! It's definitely turned off in the settings on both my tv and my phone. Uninstalled, reinstalled on both devices... Still happening.! Can't delete continue watching either. Weird .. even the free streaming services offer that option. Can't connect phone to tv via HDMI cable either. Why?? I can with other services. C'mon Disney, you're a big company. Do better or ditch the idea of your own half-arsed streaming service.",2023-11-16 10:51:15,1
Just like Shitlu now. Doesn't remember where you leave off and randomly plays whatever episode you've already watched before. Pathetic. Just another greedy lazy piece of trash corporation. Such a piss poor app. Doesn't work correctly on anything. It's even worse on a roku tv. Takes forever to load.,2024-04-19 15:43:32,1
"It's not just bad, it's awful. The quality of modern-day shows/ movies is horrendous. In particular, Marvel & Star Wars content. Lots of 'highlighted' Specialist programmes that cater for the minority are grossly inappropriate for kids. Now you pay extra for 4k content and ad-free access to this rubbish!?",2024-03-22 14:56:57,1
"Good content. However, the app is the worst out of all streaming services, and it's terrible on all devices... TV, mobile ect... Been having messages pop up saying 'No internet', I immediately change to Netflix or Stan and they work fine. Always pauses for buffering every 10 minutes or so even with 200 mbps download speed on Star Link, again never have this issue with other services. The app is just slow and clunky when scrolling through the content library. Fix these and I'll give it 5 stars",2024-01-24 15:36:15,2

"It would be a 5star review if Disney would create and release something that tells an in-depth story. A well thought out script minus the plot holes and unanswered questions. A script that isn't written using AI, algorithms or is only supposed to make money. A healthy dose of real stunt work that isn't just CGI with actors pretending to pretend to interact with imaginary eye-lines and stuff that isn't there in front of green screens, would be nice too!",2024-02-23 05:19:58,2
"Downloads break the whole app. While they are running, the app is not loading anything or loading really slow (wait time of multiple minutes). Even worse when the downloads take forever. I can download like 10 entire series on Netflix while a single episode in Disney+ is downloaded. The problems don't stop here. Half of the downloaded episodes only showed black screens. Based on reddit these problem exist for years already...",2024-02-10 02:15:43,1
"The one star is for the mobile version of the app, not Disney+ as a whole. Often, I would go to watch a video and it just wouldn't load, even if I downloaded it first. When this happened, it would continue for weeks at a time before randomly working again, then stop again a few weeks later. Since the Disney+ platform doesn't change much from mobile, to browser, to smart TV, I figure there isn't much else to rate the app on other than just working consistently and with quick fixes when it isn't.",2023-11-01 02:19:09,1
"This is feedback for the app itself, not the video content as that's a different thing. This app is the worst for UX and functionality of the major streaming services I've used so far, ranging from losing progress saving on videos, inability to watch saved videos when offline (aka, the whole point of saving a video) to an array of Chromecast issues so big that this app should only be considered partially-supported. Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video and NOW don't have these issues.",2024-01-19 00:50:18,2
"I like the app and use it regularly on my home hub and Samsung. My only gripe is on the Movies search function. They have removed the A to Z search function so you can't see all movies in one list. When you search under different categories you see the same movie multiple times as it appears under more than one category. Sometimes you just don't know what you want to watch and want to run through the library. Please sort this out. It is available for the Series search option, but not movies.",2023-12-29 21:19:08,4

"Disney+ was my favorite app untill it made me install this new update. Now it's constantly lagging, I updated this morning (10am) and now i am unable to watch anything at all. All of my other streaming services work great so I know it isn't my Android smart TV malfunctioning. Very disappointed.",2024-03-12 02:09:47,2
What's the point of letting us download movies and shows to view offline only to have the service give you an error telling you you can't access your videos because you're offline. Not offline friendly.,2024-04-22 20:40:45,2
"Absolutely mirror a previous comment in regards to downloaded films not always being playable when offline. It simply won't load them sometimes without me turning my internet completely off. Secondly, it does also lose progress in films and shows as if I have never seen them. Content good but the UX could be improved. I have also now just got a new android phone and upon logging in for the first time the app kept crashing regardless of closing and reopening. I have now deleted and redownloaded.",2024-01-24 17:55:53,2

"I tried to resubscribe after my card payment changed and I put in my details , got sent to my app to verify it was me, then it took me back to the payment page to verify. This happened twice then I just deleted it. Very worrying",2024-04-23 18:40:55,1
"Made an account a few days ago. App has crashed multiple times, keeps freezing on loading screen, keeps stopping to load while im trying to watch anything.... its been quite a frustrating experience so far. The touch screen seems to be less sensitive also, its harder to just pause or skip 10 seconds, usually taking a couple goes to work. That has been quite annoying, i have adhd and tend to miss parts of movies so do use the skip back 10 seconds feature. Just really annoying ao far",2023-11-04 14:22:22,1
The app seems to rarely or never track played episode progress (eg the blue bar) when casting to Chromecast. I end up having to skip through episodes I'm not sure I've seen. Super annoying. Moved to one star because of the absolutely terrible fast forward/reverse. Doesn't show you the time you're moving to so you're left to guess using an awkward slider that has very little precision. Pretty basic stuff for a video player!,2023-11-04 10:41:12,1
Very disappointing. After having app on Samsung tablet for 5 months. App wanted to update after a few hours use this evening. Wouldn't allow update had to unistal. Went to download again and now not compatable with tablet. Disappointed after just renewed.,2024-02-27 22:33:39,1
"Worst app out of any of the video streaming services I've used. Very glitchy, always have trouble when trying to use chrome cast to play on my TV, it takes forever and a few attempts to play the video. Then when I want to go into the app to pause the video, it's like nothing is playing and I can't control it. Really disappointed for such a big company",2023-11-23 21:07:16,2
Finally a place to watch all the classic hard to find Disney movies and shows. Great app with tons of Disney content both new and classic. Well worth the $7 a month or $70 a year.,2024-03-26 20:37:41,4

New version is NOT COMPATIBLE with AndroidTV. Disney didn't need to reduce androidTV compatibility by building app with higher version ADK and excluding lower versions. Go and replace TV now? This is how electronic waste is created.,2024-03-29 14:11:49,1

"A disgraceful streaming experience. Good content but using it frustrating at best. Takes at least 10 seconds for the screen to respond to your commands, pause etc and what seems like an eternity to load anything including the home screen. When you stop watching and try to start again it skips back about 10 mins which would be acceptable if the fast forward was even remotely usable. The options are somehow fast forwarding slower than watching it or several minutes a second.",2023-11-13 13:35:13,1
"While content is excellent, I do experience a couple of issues with the app itself. It took me a while to realise that aspect ratio issues in many programmes, which result in black bars on all 4 sides of my screen (Sony Xperia 5 III), could be resolved by pinch-to-zoom...! Randomly, I often see ""an unexpected error occurred"" while nothing appears to actually have gone wrong. This affects both downloaded and streamed shows. More QoL issues, but that is the most annoying.",2023-10-31 17:46:18,4
"Required DOB AND GENDER for EVERY PROFILE!? WHY, why the app need that information for ANYONE other than the account holder. At first I just said never mind, and just had everyone watch throught my profile, now it wouldn't even let me access the damn app until I input the information it REQUIRED. FORGET THAT.

For the price of the app per month you might as well go with cable or a different streaming service. When contacting customer service about the price change they give you the excuse they are cheaper then basic cable and provide a better service. Basic cable where I am is actually cheaper and the service sucks. I can watch 90% of their shows and movies else where or even for free as there are multiple free streaming services.,2024-01-21 00:53:11,1

Can't believe they have the audacity to jack up prices when their service quality is rapidly dwindling. Absolute inverse of common sense. If you are looking for a streaming service that accomodates downloading for when you are out of wifi range don't touch disney minus with a 10 foot pole. The length of time it takes to downloaded the queued episodes ( straight-up forget movies) reminds me of early internet downloading off the likes of limewire,2024-01-27 22:19:51,1
"Works for 7 months and woke up until it doesn't anymore. Error code 73, 14, 21....3 hrs router work, smart tv menus to reliant on linking with PC and phone before you can get in. You really need the passwords and details entered twice. Entered the password etc over 25 times still it won't connect. Multiple one time codes to get in, none of them worked. Ended up having to cut off subscription in Google Play as no other options available. Worst streaming service experience in usability to date.",2024-01-04 00:25:41,1
isnt hdmi compatible using a chromebook to tv. It must take alot of data to load anything bc my very poor connection hardly ever is able to pick it up or download. Its slow to load. The options when streaming are limited as well. Does it have volume option? it definitely doesnt on downloads. Some programs are difficult to hear. it keeps saying i dont have any connection. I dont have these problems with netflix.,2024-01-23 02:52:17,1

"Honestly, it's not a great app. It's lacking a lot of features and doesn't run very smoothly. It seems like they wanna save on not updating the app/services, and it's insanely annoying to see the same bugs and issues month after month. It technically works and is usable so it wouldn't be fair to rate it a one, but basically all the other streaming apps are better. Disney is a joke when they won't even TRY to fix things that they've been aware off for a year....",2023-11-01 18:04:37,2
Disney plus is now run by a bunch of drunks. They made every show repeat all the other shows at the beginning of every show. Either they are stupid or a bunch of drunks or just stupid. Either way this Disney plus is run by drunks. Onlybdrunks repeat themselves over and over again. Netflix has 1 skip for every show but Disney plus needs 2 for every show. Drunks following drunks. All Disney plus employees must be blonds to follow this tactic.,2024-03-19 16:06:20,1
"I'm still shocked of how bad this app can be considering how much money the company has. What kind of developers they hire??? Besides crashes and glitches and bugs for basically almost ALL devices. From simple cast to chromecast, to Android app, fire tv app.. It's ridiculous. Now it's a bit more stable at least and not as tremendously slow as it was before. But when I cast it gives random subtitles. Like Chinese. And you have to blind change it from the app and hope for the best. Ridiculous.",2023-11-28 01:33:32,2

All movie titles only appear in Romanian, which makes it almost impossible to know what movie to watch, based on its original title in English.

"Way Overpriced When I first got this app (just a few years ago it was 6.99/month), now it's inexplicably going up to more than double. It's by far the most glitchy app from mainline streaming services and seemingly puts out the least content. Could care less if they add filler like ""star"" I'm paying for Disney. Don't fill the platform with junk I don't care about as an excuse to nickel and dime me. Will end up cancelling and opting to keep HBO quality and Netflix quantity.",2023-11-17 01:55:24,1

App crashed my entire google cast device while playing the creator and destroyed my TV. The app is a virus. When you watch a movie about big tech destroying the world Google destroys your technology inside your home that you own and Disney promotes it like it's great because Hollywood and big tech hate America. I didn't even want to watch the creator to make app virus destroy my TV but it recommended it put it at the top.

Yes it a good app but you get what you pay for okay I'ma tell you that so if you go cheap you get ads and if you go expensive there's no ads but it is expensive every month and you will get notifications talking about you have not paid your monthly month payment for Disney Plus all I want to say is just that Disney plus don't play about the money and if you don't pay on time you will not be watching Disney 😂😂😂 lol,2024-03-23 03:14:57,4

Very annoying that when you are watching and skip forward a few times the audio becomes out of sync and I have to close the app and restart it,2024-03-26 12:50:03,1
Garbage. I log in and it tells me I'm ready to go. Try to do the log in codes via the TV and it tells me I am invalid. Then I try the website and it times out. Absolutely appalled at how much of a headache this has been considering the lengths they go to for the customers elsewhere.,2024-02-25 17:20:08,1

So many glitches.. don't understand how they can charge for this. Rarely use it because of the so many glitches with streaming. Disney is such a big name surely they can develop a worth while app. Will be cancelling today. Don't waste your money.,2024-04-10 14:19:26,1
Suddenly stopped being able to log in on my WiFi. Nothing wrong with the WiFi but was able to log via my mobile tethered to the TV. Once logged in I can watch on the WiFi. This happened on every device suddenly. Again WiFi is fine for everything else and at 400mb speed. 1 star review until it's sorted because it shouldn't be this way and only because I'm a bit tech savvy that I found a workaround.,2024-01-20 20:56:41,1

The disney movies were even available other platforms and ways before they were even released on disney+. One example; The little mermaid. That deeply upset me and felt like a betrayal from the company. Even more upsetting; renewal was $89 in 2021, to now, a completely unjustifiable amount of $140. I feel really let down.",2023-12-09 02:37:13,2

Really annoying bug making chromecast icon disappear from the app. THIS APP IS COMPLETELY USELESS WITHOUT THE CHROMECAST BUTTON! PLEASE FIX!!! How am I supposed to watch anything now???

Some decent content but for the price I refuse to pay that much just for an app I use maybe once a week. Overpriced for its value. I won't be returning unless you drop the monthly membership price.

No point in 4k when it won't stream. When the app actually works it's okay. Would prefer continue watching to be at the top.",2023-12-02 18:35:28,2
"Not 5 stars because the app seems to have major trouble allowing me to change to the next episodes of shows withiut restarting the app or waiting until the credits have rolled through, not ideal.

You click on the thing you want to watch and it can take up to 20 seconds to respond and then you have to click another button to confirm and you have to wait another 20 seconds!,2024-02-04 20:27:49,2
Disney+ is demanding personal information about my toddler before her profile can be used. Hell. No. EDIT: half of the movies on this app do not work. Legal action seems like the next step.,2024-04-22 17:58:22,1
"Ads. You pay to prevents ads. Americans are bombarded with ads everywhere we turn. We used to turn to disney for an ad free experience. Unfortunately, even disney has turned to the consumerist ways. I have no respect for disney now.",2024-04-05 11:49:37,1
"The app keeps getting stuck. If I connect to Chromecast and don't immediately start some movie, then the connection is lost and cannot be returned, I just get mysterious error messages. The only option is to disconnect Chromecast and wait for it to reboot. Disney+ is the only streaming service where this happens.",2023-11-21 12:13:36,1
"The app for Android Shield TV is very clunky. To the point where it crashes if you ask it to do something taxing, like pressing back... or skipping to the next episode. Instant crash or hangup. Hell, even playing a 1080p vid causes the app to crash, sometimes taking several attempts to play an episode or film. Get it sorted!",2023-12-12 01:15:46,2
"it was a good app, especially on the firestick, now it's gone like many others, pushing useless ads, especially pushing their own content WHY? If i want to watch something, i will look for it, I don't need ads telling me what i might be interested in or should watch, just spoils the content you are watching 👎💩💩",2024-04-04 10:16:17,1
"Awful Awful app if I could give this a minus rating I would. Force closes. Ability to use SD card as a download location, but when you do videos won't play. Downloads hang and fail without the option to resume. App useless when downloads actually work. Shocking from one of the worlds largest companies. If I produced work of this quality I'd be on food stamps.",2023-11-08 20:53:44,1
The app was better before recent updates. Now offline videos have issues such as the kids profile won't load them and you can't switch profiles without Internet. They took a pretty good app and broke it. Support said it's by design though,2024-04-12 22:42:03,2

"Somehow they screwed up credentials between Disney and Hulu and ESPN and now every single time I try to use any of these apps, they all reject my password. The reset password flow is completely broken in the app. Once it works, it works fine for months, but when it goes wrong, it's very frustrating.",2023-12-17 04:48:33,2
"Great content, but can you make it easy to turn notifications off please? I don't want them. Also, the stupidest pin entry screen ever. Impossible to input a pin without broadcasting it to everyone in the room. Really needs improvement.",2024-02-11 21:04:14,2
Will change the review later cause I love this app however I'm extremely frustrated with how you have to go through a run around figuring out how to update payment. Other streaming services let you at least look into your account so you can pay your bill after you forget however I can't do that my accounts on hold so I literally can't even get back in if I wanted too change things. Literally hulu I pay it and I can instantly get back in. Yet I can't with disney+.,2023-11-13 19:23:28,1
"11.15.2022.....This app is the worst. Keeps buffering and shuts off. Hire some IT people that know what they're doing or invest the money needed to make it work. Cheap bstrds....11.20.2023....One year later after cancelling I resubscribe. The app is still functioning horribly. Loses connection with Chromecast, audio is choppy, and rewind is sluggish. Can't believe I gave it another shot. Plan on cancelling after just one month of signing up.",2023-11-26 19:10:57,1
"I love that you can combine Hulu with it,but my only issue is that the app on my TV always makes me put in a new password every time because it tells me I have the wrong password when it don't.

"I really enjoy the collection of films and TV series to watch. I would have given 5 star's and the reason I haven't is because of the rewind option. I cannot find any options to change the amount of seconds, 10 seconds isn't long enough and it's really hard work when you are trying to rewind any other amount of time. It becomes really slow and lags a lot.",2023-12-01 20:53:14,4

"Disney, are you reading this? You canceled She Hulk! I loved it! You said the cgi was $25 mil per episode. You could have hired a double like Chyna or given an opportunity to a tall actress like her. I loved that series, the writing, the premise. Bad call in canceling it. You clearly have not watched it or appreciated it. It is like the New Buffy. I don't think you understand what people like.",2024-03-31 06:36:00,1
It's great I have access to most of my favorite childhood movies. That being said. It would be fantastic if the app even worked the right way half the time. I'm paying money for this? The inconsistencies are great and constant and I have no idea why I've been putting up with it. Five stars so I'm not buried in the bottom and as many people as possible can see this,2024-02-29 00:14:19,5
"this app regularly does not activate after pressing the icon. Netflix, Amazon Prime, even Hulu, I press the app and the app is very Plug and Play no issues like with the Disney app.this has been happening for definitely about 60 to 90 days,, so why am I paying for a service that doesn't work half the time.all my software on the other apps is a regularly updated without any issues error anyadditional support or input on my part.but not this chinky app.",2023-11-08 19:17:48,1
There's something going on with the settings. Shows and movies that I am done watching keep randomly showing up in my continue watching list. There's no way to remove them and customer service is useless for this issue. There needs to be a way to remove shows and movies you've completed or don't like.,2023-12-09 23:21:59,2
The WORST APP EVER!! This app does nothing but buffer!! We've had it for YEARS! The only reason we still have it is because we have grandchildren! It's too expensive for it to just buffer every 7 to 10 seconds. I'm not exaggerating! It constantly buffers!! I'm going to talk to him about cancelling our subscription because id rather buy the movie's we like when they are on sale or I can find them for $4. We can also rent them somewhere else. So PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO FIX THIS!!!,2024-01-26 22:18:49,1
"On S23 ultra I close the app and it plays on pop-up and I couldn't close it. On Samsung TV the app constantly freezes and I have to uninstall the app, install and then log in again. Also when an episode is done like a short episode of Minnie's bow toons, it takes 20 seconds to go to the next episode. My toddler doesn't need to see credits for 20 seconds. When you replay an episode, it starts at the credits. By far the worst streaming app we use. With the money you make there's no excuse.",2023-12-27 02:18:01,1
I finally found a series that I enjoyed watching. A Million Little Things. Because I'm on vacation I didn't watch it for 2 weeks. And now it's just gone... I'm very unhappy because whatever the rules say but i pay to watch what I want and the content shouldn't be removed just like that.,2024-03-15 22:53:12,3
there needs to be an option to remove things from your watch history & I don't need my small child able to view Hulu content as it circulates on this app. keep it under that specific tab or not at all!!!,2024-04-07 21:49:34,1
"This app constantly logs my TV out and then will not accept my password. On top of that when I try to reset my password I never get a password reset email, but I get the emails for a one-time password code. Also, when I download movies and shows to watch they never play because it says I am in airplane mode. I expect more from Disney. This is the worst mobile app I have used to date.",2023-12-20 04:38:42,1

"It's a shame, some shows are available for streaming in some countries a few days later (or not at ali). Taking in mind the Disney MARVEL & Fox's merge. it's expected to have a massive catalog of collections & the shows would respect the fans with more emphasis on the quality & reliability instead of quantity and cancelation after one season. Oxymoron the fact that a group that has so many talents in ILM & PIXAR can't provide a working application compatible with more devices & versatility",2023-11-23 14:53:18,2
You would think with all the money disney makes they would be able to make a quality app to use. I swear that this is the only tv app that buffers more than it actually plays the show/movie. Fix it disney or I'll just pay for hulu and buy your movies one by one on YouTube.,2024-03-15 05:10:28,1

I am disappointed with this app at the moment. Everytime one device logs into the app it forces us to change our password whenever another device in our household wants to log in. And once we do the other device that was signed in it logs out. We have tried to solve this issue by uninstalling and reinstalling and checking connection but nothing seems to be working. And its becoming more of a hasel than what it's worth just to change passwords. I hope this is an issue that becomes resolved.,2023-11-16 22:41:28,3

Not so much the Disney Plus. But more of the Disney plus channel itself because I've never had a channel reload as many times as the Disney channel does kick me off to the main screen again over and over it's the only app I've ever had that does it constantly it's not even worth watching One show for me anyways can I get so irritated by trying to watch a show and then it's constantly reloading and like I said it's the only app that I have problems with and I have downloaded it re-downloaded it,2024-01-15 00:00:16,2

"I enjoyed Disney Plus on my phone, but trying to cast it to my brand new TV Vizio. it doesn't stream as well as it does on my phone and gets a little frustrating so I have to watch it on my phone which is a smaller screen and I'm old. otherwise it would be five stars",2024-02-06 16:19:39,4
"I have enjoyed Disney Plus for years and have really appreciated the group watch feature because I live out of state and my family all live far away and the group watch feature was a great way to connect with them while watching movies, but I just found out that the group watch feature on Disney Plus has been removed. And this genuinely makes me so sad because living out of state it's hard to feel connected and now I lost one more way where I can feel closer to them.",2023-11-03 01:53:13,3
"The app is so bad that overrides my TV settings and switch on the motion flow automatically for every content that has Dolby Vision, and it can't be turned off!!!

Login is slow and buggy (sometimes doesn't recognise my pin). Downloads don't always show up in the download section so have to scroll to relevant page for each programme or movie to find them. Stopping and starting programmes can be slow sometimes 10 seconds after you pause and press play to restart. When using the app to download content for plane journeys it often won't play shows that have been downloaded. Really unreliable.,2024-04-07 22:15:29,2
"They Removed Group Share, which was one of the best features available. Ridiculous especially when it means that most people now are stuck watching movies and shows alone since they cannot watch with long-distance people anymore.

Like may streaming services it falls short with foreign language shows like Parallels. In the show details it should list what language the production was shot in. In the audio selection it should say which are dubbed and which are native. In the subtitle selection it should offer subtitles with and without CC. There should be a global setting so that you can set whether you prefer dubbed audio or native audio and subtitles for foreign language productions.,2023-12-09 09:56:41,2

would have given five out of five but the new price increase is so out if order. £10.99 and I've cancelled and won't be renewing. They can preach all they want saying its needed to keep the top notch level (Disney's claim) of shows & films coming but I don't believe it for a single second. it's nothing other than greed and yet again nailing the standard person out in the world.,2023-12-19 17:23:20,3

Im thinking Im just going to let this service go.,2023-10-31 18:17:01,1
App keeps buffering. I have many other streaming apps so it's not my wifi. It makes the shows almost impossible to watch with the constant buffering. Seems like a known issue for a long time. Disney keeps taking money from people and provides a subpar experience,2023-11-26 18:46:15,1

"fine when on wifi, buffers a lot on data and I have good data. The content library is pretty decent, lots of oldies and some decent exclusives. I don't think I'd recommend paying to watch, though. If you can get it for free that's the best way to go about it.",2023-11-12 16:35:52,3

I liked that I got to watch all the Star Wars but now the usefulness of the app is finished especially after they threw an ad in my face when I have no ads in the middle of the movie. It's like they can't help themselves! The obsession with advertising over media is disgusting in this country. The last thing I want to hear in the middle of a movie experience is bowel movements or what I should and should not talk to my doctor about. It's absolutely sickening,2023-12-19 15:03:47,1

I cannot give this a five-star because Netflix Hulu peacock and a lot of other stream faster than Disney because sometimes it won't come in I use AT&t unlimited data...

Fastest is not the best,2023-12-29 18:10:36,3
It used to be really good but when ads came along it was just absolutely horrible whatever there's an ad the screen always buffers and stays black. I couldn't even start a movie because of that and adding ads is just ridiculous some streaming sites do not need ads especially since we already have to pay for this there's no point in having ads if we already have to pay.,2023-12-03 06:45:38,2
"I subscribed and paid and keep getting an error asking me to update my profile - which I did. The app still does not allow me to stream, support does not answer. Terrible experience especially if you're trying to compete against Netflix. I am very disappointed",2023-11-26 20:53:45,1
Ad version is intrusive. Watching an 8 minute cartoon and an ad pops up in the middle of it is just wrong. And ad before and after the cartoon would be fine. As for longer videos (tv show or movie) I haven't checked out. I would hope ad breaks are strategically placed to not mess up the flow of the video.,2023-11-23 15:09:33,3
"Buggiest streaming platform - Disney+ on browser does NOT play if you have progress any episode on a different platform. To fix this, you need to have something playing and then start that episode in the browser you want to watch it on. - Casting anything from phone to TV does not work - If dialogue is not English and there is baked in subtitles, the Disney+ subtitles will remove the subtitles instead.

"Overall not a great user interface. Multiple attempts to trick you into agreeing to mailers even after saying no once. Having to input a password on the Android TV app is an idiotic design choice.

I wrote a review a before with a one star and I am writing it again - DO NOT GET DISNEY PLUS and definitely do not give them your credit card. I am referring them to fraud because they will make it near impossible for you to cancel your subscription and will continue to bill you. I have asked them 3 times to cancel my subscription and stop billing me and they will not. I have never had this problem with a service before. The only option I have left is to get my bank to block them from billing me,2024-01-20 03:49:47,1

The service is clunky. The forward and backward feature is trash only on this app. The Web and PC version work just fine. The UI is also really outdated. Like 2017 Netflix. Plus since the elon musk debacle and trash Disney movies nothing worth purchasing on this app. Save your money and pirate what old marvel movies you wanna watch. Save ur money. This app is really not worth it. They got some TV shows and things recently but nothing you can't pirate add free anyway. Take care lads.,2024-01-18 00:08:55,1
"The quality and amount of the content have decreased while the price steadily increases. I don't have wifi at home, so I downloaded movies and shows while in town to watch later. Now, I can't do that, and if I choose to watch while in town, I waste more time with all the ads. Having grown frustrated, I also started learning about how unethical their business practices are. At this point, I am not only deleting the app, but boycotting Disney entirely.",2023-11-02 06:01:08,1

"Hoping this helps other parents. Do not buy a cheap android device and think you can just buy an SD card to load Disney movies on for flights etc. Currently putting more than 5 movies on an external SD card causes the app to basically stop and it takes ages for them to load\play. Load them on the internal memory and it all works fine, however you're now limited to how many the internal storage can take.

Terrible app. Moving forward or backward in time is nearly impossible. The sorting is such that you can't find anything. No next episode button in the currently played one. Netflix is much better.,2023-12-07 17:43:26,1

Not able to see the current streaming speed/quality like you can on Netflix. Also DOLBY DIGITAL/DTS not working via an optical out put on Sony 65 x900e. Only stereo channel works.

Works great on my phone. Disney Plus on my Chromecast with Google TV keeps having frame skips. App needs to be updated to allow frame matching. Cancelling my subscription until you can fix your app issues. Not worth the price increases with a barely working app.,2023-11-11 16:10:03,1

I really like Disney and the app has a lot of things on it that I would like to watch but my biggest complaint is that if I'm watching a movie it takes up all my data and no other app does that I don't understand why the Disney app would you so much data for one I get 15 GB of and it literally used every bit of it and I didn't even finish the movie I don't understand what your lag time is or what the issue is but it seriously needs fixed,2023-11-07 14:27:18,2
I love Disney content more so for adults where a good bit of the movies and Disney shows are concerned. I believe Disney should work on creating content for the 9-11 and 12-15 age groups. There is Content in alot of the shows that is either too young or too old for those age groups and preteens end up watching content that isn't suitable for them.,2024-01-21 22:33:12,5
The download feature is annoying on planes that offer free wifi for messaging or whatever. The app does not understand this concept. Only way to watch downloads is if turn off wifi entirely.

I went into my Disney + account and changed my subscription from Premium to Standard. I thought I was successful because I received an email from GP advising me that I had changed my subscription.

Over priced for the content. 2 stars it might be worth it to others. Had Disney for 4 years with the earlier price locks and decent pricing. That being said unless your a die hard disney fan or have kids the content wasn't worth the cost. They keep pumping out new content and it just isn't very good either story or production wise.

"Frustrating. The new update happened, logged me out of all my devices and when I try to log back in it says incorrect passcode even though I am putting the email and haven't even gotten to the passcode portion. I can't even input the email and password manually",2023-12-22 01:11:22,1
"It's really good app and I love being able to watch things I haven't in years! However, I would really like for the app on mobile to be able to be where I can watch it while doing other things on my phone.",2023-11-07 01:35:35,4
"Lately doesn't work at all, just says unable to connect to disney+. Used to work better. Good shows but can't recommend to pay for it now as it doesn't work most of the time. Edit: has been working well for long time",2023-11-22 20:40:21,5

"It was a good app, but their prices increased too fast. The streaming prices are becoming too much, I'm probably going to stick to paramount and prime video for a while.",2023-11-01 16:03:05,1
It was a good app at first but I don't see a lot of new features. Increasing the price but nothing new. I'm using this app on tv and two of my mobile but it doesn't update on my other phone for awhile now. It's not a very old phone but it won't update. I love this app but please don't make me cancel my subscription,2024-01-19 05:22:49,1
Login problems too often. Have had to reset the password too many times. Still have 2 weeks of free trial but I'm gonna go ahead and cancel and delete the app.,2023-11-13 21:13:45,1
"Edit: I just re downloaded this app as the Disney hulu bundle and I can't watch anything on Disney+because its stuck buffering, no matter which shows or movies I click on. I sat here for 5 minutes trying to watch a movie and it didn't get past buffering. A waste of money 🥹",2023-11-07 01:09:28,1
"Who doesn't like Disney+? You get to watch the old classic that are not on the air like ""That's so Raven"" and many more from new too old shows and movies. There is also different thing that you can find that isn't Disney. This app is great for the kids to watch and the, adult also get to watch their show too. I guess you can say it's a win-win for all. If you don't have Disney+ right now what are you waiting for. GO get it now and go watch movies and show, with your family and friend. BYE!!!!!!!",2023-12-25 18:45:39,5

Disney Plus has become a real joke it never works anymore the only thing you're able to watch are the commercials none of the shows or movies are watchable because they don't play. Disney better update the app or it's going to lose a lot of customers .,2023-12-14 03:26:32,1
"The worst streaming app, particularly when casting to tv. Constantly freezes so you can't just simply pause and will forget where you are up to. Not worth it.",2023-11-17 02:47:40,1
The super low volume on some media needs serious attention. Long overdue frustrating issue. Also can't disable it from nagging to get added to my Google account recommendation list EVERYTIME the app icon is clicked.,2023-11-12 18:58:41,1
"Keeps default to Chinese subtitles but English is selected in menu. Have to turn off the subtitles, then back to English to get them working for every movie.",2023-11-29 21:01:15,2
The content is amazing but anytime you want to change something with the profile you have to use the app and EVERY time I try to log into the app I have to change my password. EVERY TIME!!!,2023-12-16 19:56:59,2
"This company is a sham. Their bundle deals are no longer bundles, and instead, you will need to pay an additional fee on top of your bundling price (for hulu, disney+ and espn+) to access Disney+ services. This goes for all bundling options regardless of the price of paid. This company is comprised of scam artists.",2023-11-16 05:55:48,1
The app was perfect until the updates happened and now it freezes all the time and I have to click on the movie several times and wait for it to open and play. I don't like it anymore 😠,2024-01-05 09:12:57,1

"Never had a problem until the last two days. App just keeps ""loading"" .. have cleared Cache, unistalled and reinstalled..tried everything.. but just won't open. May end up cancelling my subscription.",2023-11-19 10:02:25,1
I love the shows presented on Disney plus. I have the bundle with Hulu. They increase the price for the no Ads bundle. I use to be able to watch Disney plus without the ads. I really hate that.,2023-11-09 01:01:57,2
Don't understand where Disney gets off. Unsure if they're aware that kids don't even like them anymore but raising their prices by an extra £3 a month (again) is ridiculous. Hardly anything decent to watch and anything worth watching is available elsewhere cheaper or free. Wouldn't bother,2023-12-04 08:29:31,1
"Loved it, till they did some sort of update🙄🙄can access it on my phone but when I try to RELOG back in on the TV it's trying to double charge me for ANOTHER SUBSCRIPTION when trying to log in for the TV, doesn't even give the option to log in just from TV",2023-12-24 15:59:20,1
Very good selection of movies. especially old gems and new. however occasionally app freezes to buffer which is annoying. overall its Brilliant!,2023-11-21 11:46:08,4
"selections are limited and new content is slow to reach this platform, most new content is small shorts, could use more variety of options for things like reality tv, action movies that aren't super hero, hot tv shows",2023-11-10 05:11:41,2
Poor connection. This app can never connect to the network. Always forgets where I am in an episode. Extremely frustrating. I just want to finish this series and then I'm OUT!,2023-11-07 15:36:18,1
"Seems to work fine for me, but could really use a hide or not interested option for videos. I also couldn't find a previously watched list.",2023-12-11 09:38:48,4
This app causes issues in Samsung phones. For some reason if Disney+ is installed it causes screen lag when unlocking the phone in addition to other seemingly random times.,2023-12-20 02:55:09,1
"Love some of the content, but I hate that the big studios like Disney, HBO, etc. are basically turning streaming into old cable. You have to have subscriptions to multiple streamers to be able to watch the few shows you're interested in on each platform with the rest of the content on each of no interest.",2024-01-03 03:55:40,5
"This app has good content and stuff, but every single time, without fail, I click on a show/movie it refuses to load, this has been happening for a while, would be a great app, if it worked.",2024-01-10 02:38:21,1
Two-factor security is unreliable in a super pain Hulu and ESPN Plus. It's a good thing they're offering $5 an hour for re-logging into everything over and over again,2023-12-05 23:08:35,3
Constant buffering when used with Google tv dongle. All other streaming apps work flawless. On Disney Plus the only thing that's possible to watch is 'frozen'.,2024-01-01 23:33:10,1

"Great content, fast streaming. I like the download feature and the layout is easy to navigate too. Would be nice to see a picture-in-picture feature like other video streaming apps have N",2023-11-21 00:30:23,5
No videos play. Keep getting error code 39 when trying to stream and error code 83 when trying to download. Cleared cache. Restarted. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Currently a pointless app.,2024-01-26 21:26:18,1
Disney+ sucks u lose one bar and u can't watch any movies and it won't let me watch my show like right as I click my show and all it shows is a black screen with a circle in the middle and thats all it does and it does that to like every movie and when my phone turns off from waiting so much it shows me a link for help like I don't want that I want to watch my show and my mom is paying allot of money just for it not to work?! THATS DUMB DISNEY+ UR LUCKY I GAVE YOU A RATING!!,2023-11-12 16:16:33,1
sloooooowwwwww! why is it soo slow?? maybe adding Hulu wasn't a great idea? it buffers every 45 seconds. I can't stand it. if not fixed soon will be canceling my bundle.,2024-01-02 04:52:07,1
"It's a good app, but really hard to amend subscriptions. I can't see any way to change on Google Play without cancelling and letting it lapse! Needs sorting!",2023-12-10 16:29:27,3
I absolutely love being able to watch all of the Disney shows that ended that I grew up watching as well as some of the shows that I didn't get a chance to watch when they were still airing due to being in the US and the show being a Disney Latin American show or movie that I enjoyed watching that stopped being played on disney channel,2024-01-18 19:34:34,5
"The streaming service is good. The app looks good, but the functionality is disappointing, mostly around casting.",2023-11-26 10:02:42,2
The mobile version of this App is Absolutely awful. You can't change anything and the settings option is a joke. It took me TWO HOURS to cancel my subscription to Disney+.,2023-11-27 20:56:42,1
"Worst streaming app out of them all, doesn't work on Google TV, doesn't work on phone when trying to cast to a TV. What good is the app if can't watch any of its content. Unsubscribe, because what are you paying for other than terrible service.",2023-11-21 21:42:42,1
keeps getting error messages . not much content to watch .. volume very soft.. have to use Bluetooth headphones or speaker to hear the audio. might consider cancelling subscription.,2024-01-05 02:41:13,1
This app has been phenomenal until just last week. Have a brand new sony Bravia and then built in disney app doesn't load at startup. Just continual circle of death. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled multi times for no help,2024-01-18 03:13:15,2
"Who is giving this app 5*?? Cannot log in on my phone. Keeps glitching. Even though I have downloaded content I have to be connected to the Internet to log in. Considering what you pay for Disney + the app is awful. EDIT: Worst app I've ever used. Makes my phone crash often and I cannot even watch the content I've downloaded. When will this improve? EDIT v2: I'm going to uninstall. Why have an app that takes up so much space that you cannot use?!? Seriously, who is giving this 5 stars, Mickey M?",2023-11-19 22:15:31,1

"They removed the best feature, GroupWatch. I wish they would bring it back because I would like to watch movies together with my girl who is 500 miles away from me, and this was a favorite pastime of ours.

please dont shut down Disney+ you would be making a very massive mistake & even anger millions of Disney+ watchers you will lose even more money because no one is not going to convert to Hulu just to watch Disney+ content it's just a terrible business strategy instead why dont you people managing Disney+ improve the subscription service? the best way to attract more Disney+ subscribers is by adding the premium subscription to the standard subscription instead of making it separate? do better🤦‍♂,2023-12-30 08:40:12,4

I think it's pretty good compared to netflix and significantly easier to significantly into then all that annoying stuff for netflix and multiple plans and even ads and games no one will play and the films and series on disney plus are most of the time better,2023-12-27 23:24:56,4

App doesn't want to work and spend far more time looking at screens which either say 'something went wrong try again later' or it just buffers a round circle for the longest time again and again....what a waste of money and time,2024-01-20 09:01:06,1

Disney y'all have proved yourself to be greedy because even though you do not fix any of the problems and I even sent you an email to support letting you know what the problem was you'll never responded yet y'all are going to increase the price no one is going to use your app now there are other streaming apps like Netflix who does not have a problem with working offline after having a video downloaded and I even let you know I was getting an error code of 41 half the month that I paid for.,2023-11-11 15:57:33,1
Sometimes it works fantastic. Other times when on the Amazon fire tablet it lags ... Other apps zip quick on the fire. So I am thinking it's the Disney + app. Might need updating on the developers end.,2023-11-03 15:14:01,3

If you want to go to the episode list instead of continue watching, you have to look up the show separately. Search function only gives around 12-15 items and isn't accurate. Minimal browsability, needing to know EXACTLY what you want. Trying to look up genres like in Netflix is impossible.",2023-01-28 01:33:35,1

The same thing happens when I click on a show/movie from the home screen.

"Terrible service. Useless download feature. A main factor that the download option is that it gives you the opportunity to watch videos offline. A very (usually) useful feature. That is unless the videos don't load if you're trying to play them offline, but that's not gonna happen right? I used this feature due to my situation at home as of recently so I downloaded about maybe 10-20 gb worth of content so I wouldn't get bored. It only gave me an error message and I'm unable to watch anything.",2023-06-24 20:40:12,1
"Not even talking about disney as a company, this app works horribly.

"It has been good so far, more often than not it works fine, although on the ps4 there are many times where it will start lagging and sometimes eventually freeze up. On my phone it works great. Only thing I would have to say as a complaint is when watching a series it does not save where you are at so you have to remember, one of the few things you guys didnt copy over from Netflix. Edit: so you guys added in the continue watching, great. The ps4 version is still super glitchy and unstable.",2019-12-19 03:03:11,2
"The content is great however the lack of the Fox produced properties (Deadpool, XMen, Fantastic 4) is surprising considering Disney purchased the company. The Simpsons has a weird aspect ratio which cuts off focus jokes off. Lists like resume watching, recommended, etc are hard to find if they do exist. The download system is terrible. It attempts to download everything in the queue at once and when playing either breaks the playback function or refuses to play unless you're initially online.",2019-11-22 22:46:19,2
"I do not reccomend this app if you have an android tv. Has a good selection of movies, but when I play one, there is background music and noise but no sound when it comes to speaking.

I'm actually paying for an app that lags and freezes. Chromecast support is clunky and unresponsive. Really upsetting because this app has a smoothness and well-organized vast collection of so many classics I don’t want to have to delete. But each day is becoming more unusable.

I know it's not a problem with my Chrome Cast because Netflix and Paramount both connect with no issue (and Paramount sucks so that's saying something.)

Also, Google TV does not allow me to choose a default user profile when I use Google Assistant (voice) to play something from Disney+.",2021-02-27 02:33:27,3
First of all an amazing variety of movies and series. The problem is that I did not get to watch any of them. As soon as I click on a movie of my choice it says something went wrong. I should try later or contact disney+ subscription support which I did unfortunately they recommended me really obvious things like checking for my Wi-Fi connection ( which was perfectly fine) So I guess I guess I just spend 8.99 € on nothing.,2021-08-18 21:21:35,1

So you end up in a plane with an app that refuses to start.",2023-10-22 09:22:40,2
"Content is great, but the application is despicable. No localized content, despite good part of the movies were localized for the theatrical release. No hyperlinks for cast and crew in order to recommend content (all other streaming apps have it). No sync between devices. Restart content from the beginning after each interruption (between android phone and Chromecast for example). I wonder how long this will be the case, having great content is not an excuse for lazy software programming.",2022-06-17 19:00:30,2
"Great content, useable, easy to navigate. However, substantial quality of life improvements need to be made, like app side tracking of what episode your on, resume options for when you finish watching and resume at a later time. Not really sure what the + button is for or if it does anything when looking at details of a title. Also buffering at starts of episodes needs to be improved. When this app gets those updates it will be better than Netflix.",2019-11-17 03:28:12,3
Struggles with streaming while most other apps and services do fine. No settings for managing bandwidth or buffering. Finding content is hit and miss. Sometimes some shows do nothing when you click on them. Very basic controls. No into skip. No go to next episode. It's not smart enough to know that you've watched an episode to the credits and it should be offering the next episode under continue rather than offering to play the last 4 seconds of the episode you previously watched. No chapters.,2020-01-17 03:30:45,2
"Worst streaming service ever!! The phone app has never worked in over a year! I have had it since it first started in UK. I have asked for help many times and nothing has helped. TV app works sometimes, often doesn't work or takes 20+ mins to buffer or app to turn on etc. So is unusable. If not fixed in next couple months I will have to cancel subscription, which is a shame cause there is good content on there, if only the app was useable.",2021-09-18 22:55:07,1
"It's a great streaming service. The downloads section is really buggy and won't recognise when I am connected to wifi. I have to delete the entire download and restart because there is no resume button, due to it ""will automatically download when connected to wifi"". Nor is there a pause or resume download button, only dismiss or remove download which is silly.",2023-10-26 04:07:50,2
"Great throwback to movies when I was younger. Unfortunately on Android the app fails to connect while on wifi which means I'm constantly having to switch to data, but then I can't cast to the tv while using data. Have reset the modem, re-downloaded the app and logged on multiple times. For such a big budget company you think they'd have a working app 🙄 No issues with Netflix etc",2020-04-16 07:37:29,2
"Getting very annoyed with the app!!! It was working perfectly fine. Until 2 days ago. 😡 now nothing will load the picture and title will show up but nothing else! No play button, no episodes. Deleted and then re-downloaded the app thinking it would help. Nope! I'm frustrated! Nothing I do has helped get the app back to normal! Tried calling customer support but waited 2 hours on hold and still never talked to anyone! 😡😡😡 I'm supposed to paying for it but if it doesn't work I'm just deleting!",2019-11-17 09:18:33,1
"No matter if its on my S20+, iphone, chromecast, apple tv, or firestick; the app is constantly poor accross all platforms. Frequent crashes, slow load times, poor navigation, recently watched list keeps clearing itself. Recently watched shows, you can't navigate episodes unless you search for the show again and find it in the library. So if you miss an episode or two, you have to find that show again in the library just to pick another episode. But at least it sucks equally on all platforms!",2021-07-20 18:55:04,1
"2 stars are for the content as it is very good. But streaming/watching movies on big screens is a nightmare. 1. The video/image is discolored when streaming from an Android phone to Chromecast. 2. There is no App support on portal TV. If u try to watch on a browser, the quality is substandard. 3. ""Continue watching"" features does not resume from where you u actually stopped, on any device. 4. ""Skip intro, credits and recap"",""play next episode"" buttons are missing from the casting interface.",2022-06-15 15:21:07,2
"Does not disappoint as far as content goes! Very excited to have all these shows and movies! The only short falls, and I feel like they're big ones is the fact there is no 'continue watching' section of things you are in the middle of, no watch again section of things you've completed and the biggest biggest issue is the series' do not continue where u left off. This is a huge bummer, not knowing what you've watched and havent, having to guess and find where to start off next time.",2019-11-15 22:19:21,3
"Quick and easy to use and plenty to enjoy. Excellent value for money. A bit surprised there's not more old Disney/Fox content on there but looks like it's being steadily added to. Also the first few times I used the Android phone app content took a while to load if paused and the phone was turned off, could be it needs to sort of settle in first",2021-05-28 12:40:53,4
"The interface sucks. Lags alot and takes a long time to connect to Chromecast and randomly disconnects (never had this issue with Netflix and still don't so it's not the hardware). Watching Simpsons and tons of episodes mismatch the voice and cartoon.. But exiting app and reentering will fix it... Not sure why this happen. Also, I hate how it doesn't track the season for u... So u need to remember the episodes you are on. Overall, great content... Annoying to watch and use.",2019-11-24 06:07:22,2
"I'm enjoying the variety of shows and movies available. My criticism is the continuous play feature and episode tracking. Right now, I have to remember what episode I left off with. I have been casting from my iPad or phone to my TV but the app will only ""continuously play"" two episodes before it goes to the blue Disney+ connect screen. I have to disconnect and re-cast every two episodes. These are not issues with other streaming services and repairing it will improve the viewing experience.",2019-11-17 17:12:35,3
Great shows and movies though most of them got boring after a while. The quality is great and many things to watch. The only 2 things that I wish were changed were when you leave the app it disconnects from the interent ands it's just really annoying. The other thing is that it makes you log back in many times and is quite annoying. Other than that great app and I like it very much!,2020-07-02 02:54:05,4
"I'm basically against another streaming service, but for every now and again a month of all-Disney for this price is simply amazing. I only have one critical point to mention here: the shows and movies you're currently watching get removed way to fast from that list. I don't want to figure where I left every time and can't find a solution in the settings. Help me out here and the fifth star is granted",2020-04-01 15:18:42,4
It has been great! It would be better if you could rate the movies/shows and have a label that says watched.... it would be easier to track if you are trying to watch everything. There is a section that says a-z movies and is meant to have all the movies but they aren't all there. You have to click on them to get the other ones that are a similar title to it. E.g. 101 dalmations. Only the live version comes up. I have to look for the animated one. Overall an amazing app!,2020-04-08 16:09:33,4
The low rating isn't about the content on the app. There's a lot of good shows and movies. The issue is the app itself. It is so incredibly annoying to use. The app often doesn't register I started a new show so I have to figure out myself where I left of last time. Not to mention casting to chrome often fails or makes chromecast completely stack on the home page. This doesn't happen with any other streaming app I'm using. I just wish it was more smooth,2023-09-18 09:55:18,2
"I've had disney+ for a while now and I've had multiple login issues when logging into tv, the screen kept saying that the subscription needed to be renewed when it had only just been paid via automated payments. Streaming from phone to tv glitches very baldy. Extremely expensive for the overall ""quality"" of the app. Very disappointed. Not worth the $13.99 a month.",2023-10-20 11:28:43,1
"Has been very good for nearly a year, now (on Android) the app suddenly doesn't start up, either a never ending blue swirling circle or when that finishes the Disney+ blue screen just loads over and over. Not an internet access or App cache issue. Only way to solve it is Uninstall and download again, losing all previously downloaded content in the process. Happens again and again. Just had to do it again now. A real pain. Very frustrating.",2021-06-27 18:39:30,1
"I have issues with the app. We watch on the PS4 and find it laggy, get error messages and sometimes the wheel just spins. I paid for a years subscription as a gift to the family and feel disappointed with the service. I was really excited about having it given winter is on the way, but now sort of feeling ripped off. I hope The folks at Disney can fix this, because there is some great content (not quite enough), and it would be really great to have it work as well as Netflix, YouTube or Tubi.",2020-09-19 21:22:24,2
"The app won't advance past the initial disney logo loading screen, it's just stuck. I've tried reinstalling, clearing the cache, restarting my phone, trying different connections, my device (Galaxy S10) is all up to date. I cant even get to a login screen. I really want to watch my shows while out of the house, where I usually have the time to, but I simply can't. Absolutely no word from devs and I know I'm not the only one. Absolutely useless.",2022-09-30 21:12:58,1
"App is not loading. It's stuck to the start screen with the circle rotating endlessly. This is the first time I installed it, I tried already everything from every tutorial on youtube about how to make it work, even though I shouldn't have gone through all that normally. My phone is new and works perfectly, it's the app that has a problem. I wanted to buy one month to watch a series, but it seems like Disney does not want to sell me anything. Ugly first experience.",2022-12-14 19:55:34,1
"An incredibly buggy implementation of what should be in this day and age a main, basic functionality for a streaming app: while watching a series, it ""misremembers"" the progress 90% of the time - the progress is either shown in the correct episode, but way back than where it should be, or somewhere randomly in the previous episode. I am using my phone to cast on Chromecast, but the precision with which you can skip ahead while casting is just awful. Very frustrating overall experience.",2023-09-01 17:43:17,1
"This app from a functionality standpoint is absolutely TRASH! Yes that's right, your app is rubbish, ON ALL PLATFORMS, there is no option for video or audio quality settings, no way for anyone to rate the titles they like. Casting to Chromecast or smart tv is useless, half of the time it won't connect and when it does connect the app refuses to load episodes or movies. There's no new content either, it's no small wonder Netflix is still better than this.",2019-12-28 02:52:53,1
"Disney+ streaming service is great. The app is not. The only way you can be sure that downloads will be viewable is to watch them while you have an internet connection. What is the point of even having downloads then? Also, the app settings keep defaulting to streaming and downloading in low quality and only over wifi. Super annoying. I love Disney+ on my TV at home, but trying to use the app while traveling is an exercise in frustration.",2021-07-28 01:46:04,1
"Trash. The layout of the front page is just random recommended videos. 'Continue watching' is somewhere hidden in between and your watchlist isn't even on the front page. It doesn't have an offline mode, so if you download an episode you still need a connection to even open the app and it wastes SO MUCH data. The app constantly crashes or the screen goes black (but the sound continues). Sometimes it doesn't even let you change the volume while watching and randomly logs you out after some time",2021-02-01 10:56:53,1
"This app has come a long way since January 2020, but still has some ways to go. Whilst crashing is far less frequent, it still happens with some regularity as do hang ups or freezing. Navigation is poorly designed making it difficult to explore anything not being promoted, and forget trying to explore by tv show or movie, let alone genre. Instead there's weird filters by Disney owned studio which is a weird, dumb flex. Make your app work more like Netflix.",2020-12-18 12:51:56,3
"Overall, the App does work and is great for finding a family movie or even some explicit movies too. - one function I do not like is the groupwatch capability on mobile. There are a lot of bugs in this area and need some adjusting. For example, the 'change episode' script doesn't function as intended on most occasions. You are not able to change the episode on a series. Other problems such as group sync will lag from time to time causing you to miss parts of the scene. Most other functions=👍",2022-11-29 23:13:27,3
"Great content!! Still a few problems even after the latest update. -*Every video I play stutters at least once within the first 30sec, every time. -*When playing TV series, it only plays 2 episodes, then craps out before 3rd episode, and you have to shut down app completely before you can start next episode. -*When casting, I find that when you stop casting, it doesn't shut it down properly, video continues to finish playing, then Disney+ splash screen stays up for a few minutes.",2019-12-01 18:34:21,3
I like that this app has the classics like the Incredibles and John Carter nice to have some nostalgia with all this new age bs,2024-02-18 12:25:25,5
"Great start so far. Chromecast works 8/10 times with the stream not working or not connecting properly now and then. Few areas of improvement I would like to see though: A 'continue watching' section, a unlimited watchlist size as I found there is a limit and something showing me what I have watched before as I go along with shows or movies series. If those three things, as well as improved chromecasting and even an option to download content then it will be perfect.",2019-11-22 11:18:39,3
"It's a very good streaming app, lots of new content every week. A little bit of content for everyone. Sadly the language options change too much between countries...I find myself travelling for work constantly and sometimes I cannot change the language of my series because that language is not available in the country I am visiting. Specially frustrating when you want to see a movie in the original language and it is not available.",2021-11-13 11:23:35,4
I have always loved this app and have had it since it first came out. Never had any issues until now. Have had the app working on my Google Chromecast (newest version) on my tv and now suddenly it won't work from my tv. It will only work if I cast it from my phone to my tv which defeats the whole purpose of me getting the newer Chromecast. Every other app works fine. Have tried every troubleshooting tip on Disney+ website. If this issue doesn't resolve in the next month I won't be resubscribing.,2022-11-30 20:29:32,2
"I don't usually complain about poorly made apps but this one is atrocious, and obviously forced out before it was truly read. The app is very finicky to use: do something the app doesn't expect (download and watch a movie at the same time) and you get the Infinite Spinner. Cast to TV after starting to watch it on your phone? Infinite Spinner. There's more, but you get the idea. Constant crashes.",2020-01-25 03:03:36,1
"No option to change the language app, the availability of subtitles and audio in different languages is laughable, there is content that is only available in dubbed version (I absolutely hate dubbed movies), even the movie version is sometimes not the original (as example, the initial text on star wars written in German) with no option to switch. In summary, very disappointing not to have something so basic, especially coming from Disney.",2020-03-24 19:51:32,1
"Downloaded this app to stream video through a Chromecast to my TV. It was great at first but it seems like every time they have updated the app, it's gotten more laggy and glitchy, to the point that it's almost unusable. Get rid of your ads and other stuff causing the issues, go back to the earlier versions that actually RAN SMOOTHLY. For a paid streaming service, I shouldn't have these issues.",2022-11-04 23:35:41,1
"Unacceptable. The app crash continously, I have it on different devices and OS and is the same problem. Not only you pay for subscription but if you want to see some new contents as premium member it will cost you even more, a lot more! Some shows are missing or incomplete and the one there are on the app are ridiculous as compared to the price. Advice: hire some very good programmer and take example from Netflix! If you are considering download it just for Marvel, think it twice.",2021-03-10 10:49:14,1
"We do 90% of our watching by casting to Chromecast. Never a problem with Netflix or Plex, but with Disney+, it will only autoplay the next episode once. After that, I can't even tell it through the app to play, it just does the spinning circle. I have to fully disconnect the cast, reconnect, then play the next episode. Super annoying when all my daughter wants to watch are the shorts that are, at best, 6 minutes long 😩 Please fix this issue!!!",2019-12-27 14:54:53,3
"Have had soooo many issues with this app. I've deleted it now. It never loads beyond the open screen, so you just see ""Disney+"" with a spinning blue circle. Disney+ works fine on our apple devices, but not on android. Extremely disappointed with that fact, never mind that you pay so much for a subscription... that can only be accessed via specific branded devices.",2022-11-09 12:24:35,1
"It's got a lot of glitches. Also theres no in tv app for an Hisence tv, a very popular brand, forcing me to always connect my phone to the tv. Downloading sucks as it claims your not connected to the internet, when you are. It never reconnected after ""disconnecting"" so your always having to start all over again with downloading, from scratch. You can add tv shows and movies to a list that you can never find or access.",2020-09-27 02:29:48,3
"I love the variety and the quality of choices, the price is also great value, The only problem I have is that it's very glitchy or buggy. Some of the movies stop every couple of minutes and freeze or even exit out of the film choice. I know it's not my connection as I've never had any problems with Netflix, fix the bugs and it will be number 1. Forgot to add I run it through the Ps4",2019-12-01 12:47:27,3
"The app is slow, doesn't download the content I want to see when I'm offline, and only downloads it when I have the actual app with the actual download folder visible. So annoying that this doesn't work in the background, like Netflix for example. Moreover, it asks to update and I can't choose to do it later, which is also VERY annoying. If I don't have an internet connection, but do want to watch something on Disney+, I can't because the stupid update constantly forces me to download it...",2023-09-12 05:16:57,1
"This app has been an issue basically since we got it. Buffers badly through Chromecast, but other streaming services don't. Shows won't load, and it just kicks back to the home screen. And yes, I've done all the troubleshooting. Content is good but if I can't watch it, what's the point? Reading the reviews show me I am not alone in this problem.",2022-12-11 01:04:07,1
"Overall a decent app and it has all the TV shows that I want to watch. There is so much content. However, the app itself is just not there. Twice now it has crashed and refuses to play anything after it gltiches out. The app design is user friendly but feels a little bit clunky at times as if it could take a while to find what you're looking for. Overall not a bad app but it is very gltichy especially when watching videos. Not playing anything at all anymore, apart from that, runs like a charm.",2021-10-27 00:20:12,3
"This App on my Samsung tv started out so well but is now functioning so poorly can't or won't load without constant resetting of router and tv and even then it doesn't always work. I have cancelled subscriptions to other streaming services for the same poor performance. Netflix and Stan (Australian) services work fantastically and given Netflix has been on on my tv for longer than all of them, it says a lot about the poor quality of the Disney app. I don't recommend this app.",2023-07-09 04:52:24,1
"I like the recently added Star content which aims for a broader audience, so I am giving Disney+ another try. The app needs some improvements though: 1. While casting, there is no 'next' button to be found. 2. Automatic start of next episode takes 2 to 10 minutes due to it waiting for all credits to finish. 3. Weird stuttering/freezing during casting of some content (but strangely not all content...).4. You can add items to watchlist but this list is very well hidden (found it on profile page)",2021-03-03 23:10:41,4
"The loading is so bad on this app. Most of the time when I'm watching something, the picture will freeze but the audio will keep playing. Sometimes the video will quickly catch up, but other times it doesn't. Just left listening to the show/movie with no picture. It's incredibly frustrating and I end up just going back to Netflix or something. Very disappointing as there are so many great shows and movies on here",2019-12-11 12:17:42,2
"When I first installed the app, it worked fine until it crashed and took my phone along with it. I couldn't close the app nor could I turn off my device. I had to resort to entirely resetting the phone. Now it wont even play any of the titles, just endless loading. Although the streaming service is amazing, great titles and quality (I've used it by other means such as Roku and the browser website). It seems the mobile app needs some polishing.",2019-12-11 17:13:57,1

Also can not pause the movie/show as it just stops it completely and takes you back to the episode you started in that session.

"They have some good selections for just starting. However I am very close to canceling my subscription, because you can never watch something from start to finish without it pausing and buffering .

It won't let me add subtitles half the time (usually when I select the option, it's blank) and every time I unlock my mobile, whilst connected via any Chromecast, I restarts the whole episode/movie.

Not a good app at all. Keeps turning in circle. Won't open up most of the time. Does not play downloads unless you log in somewhere first. Take ages to download even at super high speed. Keeps crashing time and time over. I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times. Netflix and Amazon Prime have none of these issues. Downloads from Netflix and Amazon are almost instantaneous. Please fix your app asap. Not a positive experience.,2022-07-08 12:07:48,2
"For a 'premium' experience the app has gone downhill drastically since I first started using it at launch. Awful connecting to Chromecast (you have to stream to the device and as soon as it hits the Disney screen you need to hit play else it crashes), if left paused or inbetween episodes it just disconnects completely. To top it all off just recently it has stopped remembering where I left off in films and series altogether. A below par app from a company that should be able to do better.",2023-09-13 23:05:44,2
"Loving it so far, but still has a bit of work that needs to be done. Episodes are out of order, titles in my watchlist are disappearing, but still say they've been added when I search for them, needs a continue watching feature, a skip intro feature on android, and wish there was more REAL retro Disney channel shows, ie. Dumbos Circus, Welcome to Pooh Corner.",2019-12-02 16:30:23,4
"Nice, but could be improved. The interface works well enough. What I'm missing is being able to see what episodes of a series I've already seen when I'm looking at the overview of the series. Also, the 'Continue watching' section on the home screen seems to incorrectly show my progress in a series (it shows episode 2 when I'm already at episode 4 or 5). Also, it loses the connection with my chromecast quite often, which is annoying.",2019-09-15 09:57:18,3
"App is good and so is some of the content. However, really disappointed that having cancelled account at beginning of Feb, Disney+ wouldn't allow me to change my mind and continue it for previous price. It's a matter of £12 at £2/month (prices change in August), so not a lot of money for a big corp. Very disappointing and an insight into how the company operates.",2021-03-02 13:42:25,2
"Many things are wrong with Disney+. Regarding the app and the website: there are no options to indicate whether series are liked or disliked and there are no options to change the speed of the videos. Regarding the content: too much forced inclusion, too much, and a lot of series with poor narratives. I mostly watch National Geographic productions because many other productions lack sense.",2022-09-09 01:56:05,1
"I'll start with likes, I like the browsing features. Way better than the Netflix layout. Now for the bad, it desperately needs a 'continue watching' feature. I have to search for what I am in the middle of every time. It almost never saves my place if I stop something and want to finish it later, pair that with the worst scroll feature for finding your place. The chromecast feature needs work, but it's not nearly as bad as people are saying, for me anyway. It does lag a bit, but it's tolerable.",2019-11-22 14:03:13,3
"Good streaming service but there are a few bugs that need to be worked out. Lag issue, auto-play doesn't always work. Continuing where you left off is a major selling point and is annoying to have to figure out where you were and what episode you were on. Love the selection though and can't wait for more original and older shows to become available!",2019-11-18 14:28:53,4
"Poor user experience compared with other streaming apps. You can't clear shows you don't want to watch anymore or are done with, they stay in the list with 2 minutes unwatched (credits). Similarly, when you finish an episode (credits unwatched) then come back later to watch the next ep, it will continue to play the credits from the previous episode. There is, however, a good mix of shows and movies.",2023-01-22 09:47:29,3
"Similar to other reviews - I enjoy the variety and great content. However, this app is still behind what Netflix can do. It would be great if it had a 'continue watching' section as I find I cannot pick up where I left off on a show/movie. Also, I find that when I am currently watching something the 'dial' or current play feature is not there for me to fast forward or play. The app also doesnt continually play to the next episodes and there is no skip intro feature.",2019-11-17 23:15:04,2
"Good content, but choppy playback while streaming. Like painfully choppy. I signed up for the Mandalorian. If you think it's going to play smoothly on your tv at home, it won't. Even if you meet all the suggested requirements. I'm running Chrome on Windows 10 @ 28mbps (tested) It's a good app for downloading to a phone to watch later. I'll give it two stars for that.",2019-12-27 20:36:05,2
"I strongly implore you to improve your app interface. Your competitor, N, has easy to navigate functions and most importantly, its smart functions like going to the nx episode after ending one is very crucial. Not forgetting to link the last watched on ALL devices is also what you are lacking. We don't need to go through each and every intro, so the ""skip intro"" button is exceptionally handy if it comes.

I cant find the ""continue watching"" slide, it wasnt there when I first got the app. Then it appeared for a couple days and then disappeared again. And I find when I go into a show it stops to load about 6-10 times in the beginning. And also I when you search for a title you cant always find it, or 15 other unrelated shows pop up. Other then those few little bugs, i love the app and its the best thing ever!!",2019-12-05 14:59:03,4

You have to download videos one at a time or all at once, which causes a strain on the wifi and the app causing it to freeze occasionally. Also, when playing movies on my samsung s10, it won't allow it to play widescreen. Zoomed out it looks too small, and zoomed in it cuts off part of the sides. It should have more options for the aspect ratio.",2020-04-24 19:11:32,4
"For an app that costs more than Netflix, it's alot glitchier. A lot. I constantly have problems, and only with this streaming app (I use others and never have the same issues). Obviously alot of selection to watch, but to charge $35 for new released movies aswell is just ridiculous. Just upped the price, and even more glitchy. No improvements.",2021-09-03 05:21:33,3
"I love how much content there is and the new marvel shows. However the app is pretty glitchy. Compared to other streaming apps it needs to catch up. It buffers alot, can't watch the video outside of the app like Netflix and my Bluetooth headphones can't control the video. I also downloaded a few episodes and when I went to watch them offline I got error codes. So good content, bad app.",2021-04-10 04:31:40,3
"Fantastic content... If it works! At first I had no problems with the app, but recently it's just not working at all. Netflix works fine, all the time, but I am having to uninstall and reinstall the Disney one any time I want to use it, and even then it pauses many times in any show. If the app isn't fixed then I'll be cancelling my subscription because at the moment it is a horrible user experience.",2021-06-03 11:26:38,2
Mediocre but hoping for improvements. We have it on PS4 as well as my phone and experience problems on both. The videos seems to have a difficult time streaming which we try to resolve with exiting and going back into the video but is terrible to have to continuously do. It also seems like the resume option doesn't always work and I find episodes of things like The Simpsons restart even if I had previously played part of the episode. Not sure if we will keep the program long term.,2019-12-01 17:45:37,3
"It's so great having all my Disney faves at my fingertips!! But when I try to scroll backwards or forwards through a movie... It freezes for a few seconds and then the app closes and returns to the home screen of my Xbox.... It's really annoying and needs to be addressed! EDIT: my issue stated is fixed, but it would be great if there was an option/button to ""watch from beginning"" of a movie, rather than clicking resume and then having to ""rewind"" it back to the start. Thanks Disney! :) X",2020-04-06 21:53:35,4
"The app has an amazing selection of tv shows and movies. It does have some bugs though. What I found is it freezes sometimes, gets stuck on the loading screen. The one that annoys me the most is when I'm browsing the movies/shows in the search function it constantly reloads and instead of loading more underneath where I am, it takes me back to the top of the list and I have to start all over again, many many times.",2020-02-03 00:14:06,4
This app is the worst sometimes. When it works its nice cause there are so much content. Lots of fun stuff to watch. I love that there are no multiple payment plans like Netflix. But other times I just can't access the content because it says unable to connect. I had to uninstall and reinstall the TV app. And its happening now on my phone. Might have to do the same on my phone now too. Its so annoying.,2021-07-15 01:43:36,3
"As with any brand new app, I was expecting a few bugs and I imagine after some time has passed that I'll be able to upgrade this with a better rating. As of right now, there are two things preventing this review from being 5 stars: failure to autoplay to the next episode, and the lack of mini screen so that I can use other apps while listening to disney +. Aside from those two things, the app looks good, has a good selection, and seems fairly user friendly. P.S.: please add Bones!",2019-11-12 23:56:29,3
"Works fine on my android phone and Google TV but, the app doesn't work on my PC. I reinstalled it 3 times and gave up, I just use a browser if I'm using my PC. I'd be nice if you could have the video playing while doing other things on my phone, Netflix and Amazon always have the video on top. Adding the x-ray feature that Amazon prime has would be nice, especially for the animated movies.",2022-02-15 02:57:13,3
"Possibly the worst media streaming app that I have used so far. It's like Disney doesn't realise that people use Chromecast or something and force us to use this app. There's no way to get to the details of shows or movies from ""continue watching"" (so that there's a quick way to get to the episode list). Even worse is that the continue watching feature doesn't remember where you stopped watching. Then there's how sluggish the whole thing is, takes too long to show info.",2022-02-15 10:52:18,2
Disappointed for the price. There are too many bugs going on for this price. It's been happening for months not and I thought it was my fault. I probably won't be renewing this. I wish they actually cared to fix their stuff but it seems not. Why does a downloaded movie need data to play... that's a bit pointless no?... I wasted my time downloading movies for a flight just to find out j can't watch it. And the constant buffering and freezing pathetic... back to Netflix for now.,2021-11-19 02:26:51,2
"I wrote a review a while ago. Seems to be missing as I was going to update it. Oh well! This app still has the same bugs after a few months. I can't play movies or shows from where I last watched. Subtitles go off the screen. Loading time takes forever. You get what you pay for I guess. Start fixing the bugs, you have more 1 stars then any other streaming app I've seen.",2022-06-09 13:31:58,1
Great Selection. Removing items from Watchlist is super hard. When it gets to the credits I cannot figure out how to get it to end and go back to the beginning. Every time I go back into the selection it starts back at the credits again and I have to rewind the whole thing. I have tried fast forwarding to the end and it still starts at the credits again each time. Does not automatically go to the next episode. Which is a pain if you watch the shorts and you have to keep clicking every minute,2019-11-18 03:03:42,4
"Great content, Unreliable App. The movies and shows included in your subscription are great, lots of family favourites and all the latest marvel movies and shows. The app works fine on my mobile for a short period of time and then fails to connect. I have to uninstall and reinstall to fix this issue, I have had to repeat this process too many times hence the low score for the app.",2021-08-23 08:04:56,2
"I love this app, but it needs some improvements. I'm hoping they continue to add more movies, as well, it seems to stop and load when playing a movie and I've never had that issue with Netflix. It would be nice that it would continue to play after an episode ends Instead of stopping. Or at least play and stop after a few episodes. Other then all that, love the selection and classic movies too!",2019-12-12 12:41:49,3
"It's good but needs a lot of improvement. The content is great, there are a ton of movie and TV series right now. But... the navigation is lacking. When your watching a TV show they don't have a function to skip episode or a list to change different episodes. You would have to click back. It also needs a remove function because some movies or series you've watched stays on the 'Continue Watching'. In app you always need to login in order to access your downloaded content - it's annoying.",2021-03-05 10:26:56,4
"App is very, very, slow with chromecast and takes a very long time to load material compared to other film streaming services on same devices and network. Sometimes i have to restart the app several times to get it to stream from my phone or ipad to chromecast. This isn't the case with the other streaming services. The interface could use some polishing also. ""Less is more"" would be a great . The content of Disney + is great though. I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars.",2023-09-03 06:46:07,2
"Good content. Only issue is that phone and desktop won't sync. For example, I was about halfway through a film on my phone, but when I went to watch the rest on desktop it wasn't even in my continue watching. No progress, no nothing. Also, subtitles often don't completely line up with the audio, for example the subs might read ""I'll be right there"" but the actual line is ""one sec, I'll be there as soon as I can""",2022-03-04 19:12:22,3
"Disney+ content is both plentiful and very high in quality. That being said, the app has issues. It's heavy, slow, rife with random errors when you're just trying to watch a show, and for the last few weeks, it flat out won't work, saying the service is unavailable. So I have to clear the cache, delete the stored data, restart the app and enter my login info again. Every week or so. Netflix and Amazon have better apps.",2021-07-19 00:51:13,3
"The content is great, no question. But it does not show me what I have watched or resume an episode from where I left off. Also while casting if your phone goes to sleep then you lose control to pause and control what you are watching. I hope these items get fixed it has a little catching up to do to provide a similar user experience as Netflix.",2019-11-15 00:39:19,2
"First review - (4 stars) Good, but still has some bugs, like, couldn't add movies to my watchlist, but then reopened the app and now I can. I can't choose an icon for my profile or new profiles, so I can't create a new profile because I get an error. I love disney but one would figure their software would be better by this point. ----- Second review - (2 stars) The videos are freezing with a 'buffering' or 'loading' screen. I can't watch a single movie without it being stopped AT LEAST 4 times! Also, when watching a video, there is no way to resume it. Netflix has way more functionality...",2019-11-20 04:42:35,2
"With my subscription renewal on hold, I'm glad not to be giving Disney my money, due to my experience with this app over the past year. When watching content in 4k HDR/Dolby Vision (ie Marvel), flawless playback. The opposite is the case for content in standard HD, which is most of their catalogue, glitches and blue circle galore. I've spoken with their tech support numerous times, changing settings as advised, no change to playback whatsoever If you want me to remain a customer, sort it out!!",2021-07-05 11:34:40,2
"Why is there no option to select the type of audio output ( stereo or surround sound ) as there is in the Netflix app? This omission means certain TVs do not output audio when using a Chromecast. While this may not affect a massive number of users, the solution seems simple to implement, and the Netflix app has supported it for years. A strange oversight by Disney.",2020-01-04 16:58:55,2
"Absolutely love the content that is available, except I can't get anything it actually stream. Buffers for a minute, and then goes black, except if I connect my phone to my hdmi connector (no wifi). Which I find very strange considering it's still playing from my phone just through TV. Really hope this can be resolved. I've been really looking forward to being able to have this app, so it really is a disappointment that it I'm unable to watch anything.",2019-11-14 07:49:29,2
"The design, layout and functionality of the app it self leaves a lot to be desired. Feels like someone with little experience in the streaming atmosphere created this. Even skipping intros is 50/50. Trying to play the next episode from continued just plays the end of the previous episode. Trying to find the episode list is buried as well. It's also the slower one of the streaming apps. This also applies to the native app on my TV.",2021-12-15 11:54:41,2
"I've tried everything to fix the app, including clearing data and cache, deleting and reinstalling multiple times, and powering my phone off, but I'm just stuck on the loading screen + error 83. It's been like this for two weeks. I cant access any shows or my downloads, yet Disney is still charging and collecting the payment for the service. Fix it. Disney is a billion dollar company and its ridiculous that they're charging £8 a month for a service that is literally inaccessible.",2022-08-10 08:25:59,1
"How can you get this app so wrong, it's not like streaming apps are anything new. It just doesn't sync watch history. I can be in the middle of an episode, need to close for some reason, then when I go to restart, it takes me back to the start. There is no syncing with content you've watched via Chromecast. Every single free and paid streaming service I use have better apps. Content wise, excellent, love the service. App functionality, worst of the bunch.",2022-02-15 00:19:00,1
"The content would be great if the app would be decent enough to display it. I downloaded a lot of videos for a trip outside the country but surprise....none of them works with or without an internet connection, not even after being back home. Moreover, the app crashes whenever I try to start one of them, and offers no feedback what so ever. Restarted tablet, reset settings, logged in and out, switched profiles, tried it all. Really really stupid app.",2022-07-10 17:50:05,1
"Basic features like quick episode selection, skip to next episode, or previous episode, without going through the search function are missing. Rewind function is incredibly laggy, so is skipping back and forth with the progress bar. Playback freezes a lot when you do this. Really unimpressive app for a company's with the kind of resources Disney has at their disposal. Playback quality is very good however, the shows look fantastic. But the UX needs more work.",2020-05-10 21:19:00,3
"Great App with a great catalog. This would be 5 stars since I do believe they have a better selection of shows than Netflix, but the app looks outdated and it tends to fail and glitch out often especially when you cast to a TV or use it on a console. Once in a while the footage doesn't match the audio or it just freezes. Also when you cast a TV show to your TV it doesn't allow you skip the intro. Occasionally when you click on a movie the app just freezes and I have to restart the app.",2020-12-28 08:21:13,3
"Was working well until a couple of days ago when, for no reason and without any warning, the ability to cast stopped. Now, if I want to watch something, I have to watch it on my phone screen instead of the TV. Not impressed at all. Guess I'll go use another streaming service instead. Even Netflix seems like a better deal at this point. The latest update has ruined the app ever more (somehow). Crashes every 15-20 minutes stop charging people for a service if you are too incompetent to provided it",2023-10-10 01:35:32,1
"Great app, could use a little work. When casting to a chromecast, there is always a little rebuffering within the first minute of playtime and when you stop casting the chromecast gets stuck on the last screen the app was playing instead of returning to the chromecast home screen like every other app. Also when scrolling through a-z list it keeps bouncing back to the a's when get into the d's. Also uses a lot of battery on my s10 and heats it up which has never happened.",2019-12-14 18:18:07,3
"Almost perfect! The selection of decades of Disney (& partners) movies and tv shows is just incredible. The original content is also great. But the lack of audio tracks is where they have missed the marked as opposed to Netflix for example which has pretty much all the common languages of the world when it comes to original content. I was surprise to see this flaw with Disney, since they're such an international symbol of unity throughout the world. Maybe it will change with time. Will see?! ;)",2019-11-27 03:02:03,4
"The app itself is fairly easy to use, with good content. It sometimes won't stream to my TV or it disconnects randomly without a reason. The 1 star is because of how frustrating it is to cancel. It sends me to Apple music to cancel but there's nothing there to cancel. Round and round in circles. It feels like it's deliberately difficult and unbelievably frustrating to cancel as a ploy to keep people subscribed. Don't do it... It's a trap!",2021-10-05 02:45:35,1
"I don't rate apps, however I haven't had one time where the app opens, without an error screen. I find endless creative ways to work around the apps defects. IF it loads, half the images are grey boxes which means you cannot even guess at which movie is which. The only hope for this app is to increase the content with new AAA titles, otherwise this will become another blockbuster story. All the money in the world, does not always lead to success.",2020-03-21 03:41:22,1
"As a total Disney stan, I am so happy this app exists. However, there can be lag occasionally (more often than I have experienced with either Netflix or Amazon Prime). This is solved by being able to download things, albeit very slowly. My main qualm with Disney+ however, is that there is no laptop app. So if I want to watch a movie on something bigger than my phonescreen, I am risking lag. And that just plain sucks.",2020-09-03 15:14:54,3
"The selection of movies and series is nice, and the app seems to be sensible. However on our AndroidTV, the app is unusable. Whenever we try to play a movie or episode, except really old cartoons, probably with low resolution, the image freezes after a couple of seconds, while the sound continues to play. On the same device, NetFlix & YouTube work fine, using the computer.laptop we can view content without any issues. Until this is fixed: 2 stars, as the app is mostly unusable. 10 Feb: no change",2020-02-10 22:05:46,2
"Great choice of films & series to watch. Would be 5* except, recently I've found the sound keeps dropping out, which is extremely annoying, only just started doing this over the last few weeks, was great previously. I've seen other people have this problem and I've tried deleting the app and re-installed a couple of times but still the sound drops out occasionally. Any ideas on how to fix this?",2022-12-21 18:02:02,4
"App is still failing to load. Seems like a fairly serious bug. Amazed it's not been fixed. Even one week is a long time to wait for a fix. I figure the issue is only experienced by those installing/reinstalling the app, but that's got to be quite a number of users. Can't imagine why Disney would allow this to continue. I've tried every workaround suggested or that I can think of. Still no joy. Very poor user experience. 2 stars is plenty for an app that people can't get running.",2022-09-03 11:54:12,2
"App keeps on throwing up error codes and stops from loading. One minute it feels like I have poor internet connection (error code 42), and then the next minute it thinks it's in the wrong region (error code 73). Called support earlier they seemed to have given me a temporary fix - reboot the router. Every other streaming app is working fine. I'm not really bothered like their technicians to do their job and treat D+ special and to reboot router or uninstall and reinstall. Instead choosing to cancel my subscription. If they like they can call me when they fix the app, don't think I'd be missing out much or subscribe again.",2023-05-22 17:50:54,1
"The app is OKAY right now. Slow to load, sometimes content skips. It is missing a key feature - a continue watching section so you can pick up where you left off on a movie or series. I do not understand why this is not in the app, especially given that there is such a wide array of content for young kids that may have difficulty navigating through the app environment.",2019-11-17 11:13:40,2
"Update: I'm on 1.1.5 . On both desktop and android: - Resume does not work. - no continue watching section Android only: - a lot of buffering even though I'm on home wifi. - no pause when video is buffering. - had to go back to home page, manually find and restart the movie and manually seek to where I left off. It was too frustrating to even watch half the movie on my phone. 2 stars for good content, but I dont think I will keep the sub because of the above issues.",2019-12-01 22:28:35,2
"Having a lot of problems when trying to watch anything on my phone. Loads for about 10 seconds then just goes to a black screen. Works fine when I cast it to my tv or use my xbox etc, but anything on my phone is not working which is really annoying as I would like to use the app while I'm on the move. My wife has the exact same phone as me and it works fine for her.",2019-12-07 07:46:34,1
"Love the content...... It's sad but I have almost all of the ""old"" or ""out of the vault"" movies on VHS still! App needs work though. Why does it reset to the first episode everytime? Then it doesn't keep track of what episodes you've watched. So if you don't pay attention your scanning through episodes to see where you left off. Auto play of the next episode would be a nice feature as well.",2019-11-16 01:17:29,3
"The app is so slow to load that my phone goes to sleep. I don't have any such issues when using Netflix, Youtube or Prime. I did a speed test and my download speed was 30+Mbps which I know is not lightning fast but is still very good. The player is also slow to respond to moving forward or back on the time bar. If I press the +10s button it takes 20 seconds to load...",2019-11-23 20:43:36,2

Sure, I could go into the app, manually look for my show and select each time the next episode...",2023-04-11 10:48:50,2
I love Disney+ but it is really disappointing the connection issues I have been having. I paid for an entire year and havent been able to watch an entire movie yet without it stopping to buffer at least ten times within the first 5 minutes and then countless times throughout. I have tried everything they list on their website for connection issues. I even contacted my internet service provider and upgraded my internet. I have no issues watching YouTube or Netflix. Please. Please. Fix.,2020-01-25 20:07:29,2
"The content is brilliant. The formats available are excellent. What let's Disney+ down massively is the app itself. Just like others, I have come up against the ""unable to connect"" issue and the only way to fix this is to delete the app and reinstall it. The reason for my review and it's contents is due to my disappointment that no one at Disney+ seems to be bothered to fix this common issue. If Disney+ were free or unique I would understand. However, we pay for this service & expect more!",2021-10-12 23:13:41,3
Everytime I download something it glitches out and will not play a certain bit in the episode. I've tried downloading stuff on other devices and the same thing happens. It also happens when I cast my screen and when I'm watching a series or movie normally. The glitch acts as if the video won't load and briefly shows the picture of the episode before beginning to buffer again. There is no way to stop it or pause it when it does this and it is extremely frustrating.,2023-06-16 19:33:33,1
"Great to be able to play Disney movies so easily but it needs some fixes. Like a ""restart"" option instead of just ""resume"". My kids don't want to continue watching a movie or short from where they left of weeks ago. They want to see it from the start. It's frustrating not having a restart option. It has one on the playsation when I use that, so why not the mobile app? We cast everything to the TV, I'm very sick of listening to complaints because it hasn't played from the beginning.",2020-06-18 07:19:28,3
"App should be marked as beta, looking at the amount of bugs and not yet ready features. Downloading episodes is terrible, besides the fact that the screen of the series reverts back to the first season everytime. Picture in picture would be really nice (and changing the opacity of the subtitles background to 0% would be nice if it listened to that configuration)",2019-12-04 16:21:03,2
"I love Disney+, and overall it's a very well designed app. The only issues I have are very minor, but easily fixed. When casting whatever you're watching to another device there isn't any options to skip the intro, or to skip to the next show instead of having to watch the credits, and finally when skipping you are unable to see a snippet of the scenes, which makes it really hard to figure out where you need to skip/rewind to. I'm hoping this is something that'll be fixed in the next update🥺🙏",2020-07-02 19:56:26,4
"Alot of bugs with the PS4 app, it keeps pausing shows I try to watch. The sound will play but the picture remains paused. Then after 45 seconds it will rewind and play. I keep having this issue. It's so annoying. I'm not gonna pay for a service where it keeps pausing like this. I have no other issues like this with other apps like Netflix or prime. Please fix it .",2019-11-24 00:38:07,2
"Constant issues! They fix one then another bug appears! Keep getting error 83, yes apps updated, it's when I cast to Chromecasts, yes the firmware is up to date. Then after a few episodes it will appear randomly and then go, but whatever is been watched the title flashes on screen. Have to close the app, disconnect and reconnect. This app is extremely buggy! If it's not one issue it's another",2022-07-21 03:11:02,1
"So apparently this app dosen't abide by the ""wifi only"" settings. It eats your data while watching ""downloaded"" movies/tv, which defeats the entire purpose of having the option to download. I use this option regularly with Netflix and other streaming services. It's actually the only reason I use a streaming service at all! Now I've nearly spent 4 GB of data and will have to go the rest of the month with nothing or risk having to pay a fine. Funny thing, I need data to do my job. Thanks for that",2019-11-26 09:00:17,1
"It seems that the Disney Plus app is missing one essential feature common to every other streaming app and media player. There is a lack of episode tracking or next episode indicator. This makes watching series a little frustrating. I honestly thought the app would offer this core feature. Still, overall it is pretty good. I have had no issues with playback. We're it to get episode progress tracking it would be 5 stars in my opinion. Please add progress tracking.",2019-11-19 08:15:30,3
"In Singapore. Very happy to be able to see Disney+ shows finally but disappointed at app performance so far. Very buggy on mobile. No PiP, screen brightness set at max and images still too dark to see clearly. Also no in-app brightness control; have to resort to swiping phone overlay down and interface can glitch. Had one moment where screen completely blacked out and not able to use anything for 5 mins. On S10+ just updated OS.",2021-02-27 05:20:45,2
Good content. Works well so far with chromecast. However when you tap on content in your list it doesn't show the tick symbol. This means it's not easy to remove content from your list. It would be better to have multiple lists that could be shared. Also the audio and subtitle options were not showing part of the way into a show.,2019-11-19 22:19:53,3
"Well I change my previous 1 star to a 4 now. After talking with customer help, told me Disney+ doesnt work on a Linux OS, which it does. My problem was my A/V reciever is new and I forgot to switch setting. Disney+ has a great selection of movies and tv shows that I really like and also grew up with a bunch as well. I love the 1 price which gives you the same features as Netflix best package but for $10 less. It lost 1 star because of a few skips in a few shows.",2020-11-03 08:28:07,4
"When it works the movies are amazing but often it just gives me a black screen. Resume often does not work so you start the show from the beginning all the time and need to skip through.

"Works okay on the phone but it's barely functional when playing through a chromecast. Constant stuttering, loss of sound and it disconnecting leads to a very frustrating viewing experience. No issues as severe as these with other streaming services such as Netflix or YouTube, only with Disney plus.

Currently the only way I can watch is through my Googlecast and it's glitchy & inconvenient to not have access to all my streaming services in one location. The start of EVERY video freezes and has buffering issues. Also no way to see where you left off, so you have to remember which episode you're on. Edit, working better now.",2022-08-14 23:04:03,4
"The addition of the ""continue watching"" feature is a good first step. But everything buffers like crazy. I can handle a few seconds of buffering right at the beginning of a selection, but I've had a handful of times where it will start buffering in the middle of a program and then it completely starts over. Not good. Needs to be fixed.",2019-12-03 23:32:08,3
"Great app, great content, cancelled Netflix as soon as started this subscription. However it still needs some work, once that is done I'll change my 3 stars to 5. 1. I expected it will have all 10 years of Marvel movies, but it seems to be missing some. 2. Need ""resume play"" and ""recently watched"" for faster access. 3. I want a little window to watch it while doing other things on the phone.",2019-11-15 16:24:28,3
"A bit slow and laggy to load content compared to other well-known services. My biggest problem is that Offline Downloads do not work if you are offline/airplane mode, try to open the app, access the Downloads. On press play screen goes black and nothing plays. If I am online the ""offline downloads"" work. Which means not Offline at all. It happens in at least 2 of my devices that I've tried. After many updates, the problem remains. This is a deal-breaker for me since I travel a lot.",2023-03-31 17:00:49,3
"Whatever updates have been done to this app recently have caused me to cancel my Disney+ subscription. This app is unusable now, half the time it won't launch and crashes. If I'm lucky enough to get into the app and watch something, I can't watch anything else until I disconnect and reconnect to the internet, because the autoplay for TV shows causes this app to think I'm trying to connect too many devices to it. I'm the only one with access to my account. Awful experience, switching to Prime.",2022-06-28 18:28:32,1
"Terrible, cannot stream properly. Doesn't work on my phone or TV, it's always asking me to contact customer service, and then they say that it's an issue with my network and TV, well, I've been using Netflix for 3 years and it works fine, never has it ever given me any trouble. Maybe pay attention to your competitors and improve your own apps, please.",2022-01-08 11:16:03,1
"Sub par overall experience. The worst of all was the inability to start a downloaded video without having a internet connection. What's the point of downloading video if you can't watch it when there's no internet connection? Lack of controls, No realtime sync across devices forcing you to figure out where you left off, no slider in the TV app to forward or reverse videos. Too many issues. Needs lot of improvement!",2022-07-21 11:28:48,2
"Has the majority of the Disney library in here which is great. A PC app would also be greatly appreciated when not on mobile. Some general UI fixes across the apps. A recently watched section, a progress session on watching and continue playing where you last left off. Also, if there's a title that's not currently in the library an ETA on when it would be available would also help. Overall, a great solid app and can even manage subscription through Google Pay which is an added convenience.",2019-11-14 19:22:32,4
"A pretty terrible mobile experience. I love the service on other devices, but on my phone? I literally have to clear the cache for the app every 10 minutes or else it gets unbearably laggy. No exaggeration. I open the app and wait several minutes for it to load, click an episode of a sitcom, watch it stutter and buffer every two seconds(!), close the app and clear the cache, reopen the app and it's fine... for ten minutes until needing to do it all again. Netflix doesn't have this problem.",2022-04-07 09:04:26,1
"I am rating the app, not the content. The content is amazing and so is the quality. Everything is quickly uploaded. But, a glitch is constantly happening where if I am watching a video and then tap on the screen, no options show up, for example, the ones that say how far along I am or +10/-10. This has been happening for a while now, the app is fully updated and this bug is not fixed. Please solve it.",2022-09-06 13:08:01,2
"It's been great catching up on the classic Disney movies and the Mandalorian is really good, but Disney plus still has quite a few bugs and things they haven't added yet (like a ""next episode"" arrow so that you can skip to the next episode. It can be slow and crashes so often that sometimes I can't even use it. I know that they just launched and are probably working on those things so I'm a few weeks I may give it 4 stars",2019-11-28 22:11:29,3
"Great content, awful app! As others have mentioned, the app is buggy as heck. For example, downloaded shows... They won't start, unless you're connected to the Internet. I guess that it means you don't have to rely on your plan data to watch things, but what about when you're in an area without service? For example, on the underground/metro? Or a building without decent signal and no WiFi? The app itself is slow compared to Prime/Netflix. They need to sort this out, given the size of Disney",2022-09-28 16:21:41,1
"This app seems to work fine for me until I try to download something to watch when offline. Then all manner of issues arise. Programmes/ movies don't start, if I pause mid way through an episode and then later try to pick up where i left off, it resets to the beginning. Like other reviewers, it takes several attempts to delete downloads and even then, the app continues to mis-function. I have ended up deleting and reinstalling the app to get things working again. Sort it out please!!!",2023-03-02 19:16:52,2
"Worst app I have ever downloaded! I have had this app for three weeks. Great content, but constantly freezes during the progression of the show and movie. It has crashed on me twice recently, while trying to use it. To a point it might have crashed my tablet, which I might have to get fixed. Avoid this app until they fix their bugs. Thought I come back to this after almost a year. They still have not fixed the app and its crashing issue. They are increasing the fees, but unjustifiable.",2021-03-18 00:30:31,1
"After my feedback from a few months back, the app is still not fixed. Every video I played comes back ""we are sorry, we cannot play the video you have requested"" Bloody ridiculous. It was fine around the first half of the year. I have to always switch on my PC just to watch Disney plus and not able to watch on the go. Infuriating!",2022-11-04 02:54:39,1
"The first couple of times I used Disney + it was so good, the quality was good, the streaming was uninterrupted but now everytime I try and open the app it won't let me it says ""unable to connect to Disney +"" . It says to try again later if the issue persists and it's been 2 days and it's still not working. It works on my computer fine, the quality is a bit iffy sometimes but otherwise very good. Y'all need to fix the problem of the app not working on phones please and thank you.",2020-04-10 12:06:58,2
"So disappointed. The content is of course great but that is not what I am reviewing. It is slow, it crashes continuously, and it will often straight up freeze. When you press pause on a video, it takes about 6 seconds before the video will actually stop. And in regards to content, it doesnt even have everything. 'The princess and the Frog' for instance is not available because apparently it is on a 'rotation' with other countries so it only appears once in a while. Makes no sense to me. Rubbish",2021-01-07 15:46:35,1
"It takes about 3 minutes to load the movies and that's if your even lucky. Sometimes it's left on loading for more than 10 minutes and your screen locks. Sometimes need to re-attempt playing a movie 4 or 5 times with the hope it may actually work. Constant buffering during films too. The mobile app seriously needs looking into, it's so frustrating having paid for a whole year subscription and not being able to watch anything? Ridiculous.",2021-07-29 00:03:12,1
"The selection is great, video quality and streaming quality is great, but I dislike that there is no ""continue watching"" like netflix has. Its rather annoying to go into a series and have to go back to the season I'm on because it automatically gets set back to the first season of something. Other than not being able to keep track of what I'm watching and where I'm at with the series I'm watching, it's a great video service. I dont want to keep it if something that simple cant be included.",2019-11-18 13:07:25,3
"App stops working every few days. Only way to fix it is to uninstall, which loses all my downloads. I also can't open the app when I have no internet, so you have to turn on data to access downloads (which to me defeats the point)..... It's a real pain, and means I try to use the app as little as possible, because it's so unreliable. The Netflix app works perfectly everytime. Yes I'm comparing them to Netflix, it's there main competitor. Definitely not renewing Disney+ again.",2021-07-09 12:13:03,1
"Never loads and when it does it crashes. It's slow, the content doesn't show up and when it shows and I click on the series I was watching it goes back to loading then it crashes. Also the 10sec back/forward takes too long to work or the series crash. It's so annoying. It's been more than a year now that's I've been having this issues and the app didn't get any better 😭",2022-04-15 13:29:30,1
"It's a great app with great selection, like all the Marvel movies and all the Star Wars movies and a lot of series like Prison Break! You also pay for four accounts at once, which is well worth it for the price. (About 12 Dollars I think). The only negative is that it doesn't save the progress of a movie or series offline. So you never know at which minute you stopped. It would be nice if this problem was safed.",2022-09-20 15:30:49,4
"Edit: the longer I use the app, the worse it is. It crashes constantly to the point where I'm stopping my subscription. The app is unusable. Great selection of movies, but still a lot of bugs in the app to work out. It really doesn't work well with Chromecast... It will randomly crash in the middle of a show, or the streaming notification bar will disappear so I can't control it. Also, you can add shows to your list, like in netflix, but you can't find your list back anywhere.",2021-10-17 17:52:03,1
"The content of D+ is brilliant. But the app has some glaring issues with playback system. In particular, here is what happens if you tap the ""rewind by 10 seconds"" button multiple times. It rewinds by 10 seconds, then 2 seconds, then skips forward by 5 seconds, then maybe skips back by another 10 seconds or sometimes by 2 seconds. And sometimes it doesn't work at all. Each time there is a delay of about 2 seconds. It needs some serious overhaul to be fit for purpose. But still content is good",2020-03-27 04:42:47,3
"Disney+ offers some great series and movies. But the overall watching experience is a bit disappointing. I downloaded some movies to watch on the go. But when I sat down in the train to watch them, the Disney+ app couldn't connect to the server (or something) and even using cellular to log in or connect to the server doesn't work. Only when I reinstall the app it works again. But all my downloaded movies/series are 'deleted' so I can't watch any of them.",2021-08-27 10:12:45,3
"Great Content, A+ for content. The service in general falls a bit short of the basic functionality of any modern streaming service though. Biggest gripes: - Doesnt play from where you left off in a series, doesnt show you where you left off either. - No continue watching section - Poor search function. Technical issues: - On my 2018 Samsung 7 series Smart TV, the topmost category selectors (Starwars, National geographic, etc..) when clicked, displays an infinite black screen.",2019-11-19 04:48:00,3

It seems they update it according to the more popular platforms, never had a problem with it on my firestick yet it struggles and buffers like crazy on my ps4.

"shows are great, and being able to download shows is good for when out and about. My only issue is ..... it does, only sometimes, disconnect. My phone doesn't lose WiFi connection, it seems to be the App failing. you'll be watching something, it'll start to buffer and drop out. when it reconnects, it doesn't take you back to your show but to the menu. A bit of a pain in the backside, but not a mega issue.",2023-05-05 08:40:41,3
"There is one major point that is very annoying. When downloading several things at the same time e.g. a whole season of a show the app never downloads it all properly. Some get permanently stuck at 0%, even after hours, some show an error. Downloads also sometimes randomly stop saying my device does not have WiFi, but I have it all the time, and it's definitely not the problem.",2022-10-14 05:02:21,3
"The series are great. The apps control functions aren't. When I turn the tv off while playing. It doesn't resume where I was but several minutes before. No way to go to the next episode. Cannot skip the ""outtro""(the credits at the end). No way to go back to the previous menu with back, but I have to stop first? (LG webos). It's annoying.. I expected a lot better.",2023-02-10 14:40:36,2
"Only problem I've had with it is lag. It's very hard to rewind or skip ahead, and you should expect a long, long loading pause if you try it. Films will randomly just pause to load, and it's faster to restart the app than it is to wait for it to catch up when it does that (I've personally never seen it fix itself back to normalcy once it starts lagging without closing and reopening the app myself). With all the buffering, it just doesn't have a very nice flow to it like Netflix for example.",2022-05-19 16:51:31,3
"Lately, the app keeps coming up saying that it is ""unable to connect with Disney+. There seems to be an issue connecting to the Disney+ sevice. Please try again later if the issue persists"". It is happening once or twice a week and the only way to get ride of it is to uninstall the app and then re install. But doing so, i lose all the shows that i have downloaded. Edit: after a month and a half from my original post, still no update. Disney obviously doesn't care, they just want their money.",2021-09-25 06:34:28,1
"The app is buggy and it has a poor collection of shows. Everytime I try to use the app it says ""connection error"" and the only way I can fix it is to delete it, re-download and log in. This wasnt just a one time thing, a day after getting it to work, once again, it says connection error. I've done this process over and over just so I can enter the app. As well as this, just a second of slow wifi or you disconnect & reconnect to wifi, it will take you all the way back to the home page.",2021-07-08 03:57:01,1
"The variety is great. And works well on TV. Bit the app you download on your phone/tablet needs some work. Not terribly but could be a lot better. Main struggle I'm having is the fact that it almost crashes when the signal is a bit low. Doesn't buffer or anything. Just refuses to play. Where as Netflix doesn't have that problem at all. Not comparing the two, it's all personal preference. Just trying to point out that this problem can be fixed",2020-12-10 22:42:50,2
"I absolutely love this app with one exception. What is the point in having downloadable movies and shows if you can't actually watch them online. I've downloaded a variety of different shows thinking it would be great for my daughter while on roadtrips with no wifi, only to experience errors codes saying that I need to be connected to the internet. Really disappointed and wish they would look into this issue.",2021-09-26 13:35:10,2
"Great and enjoyable selection of shows. However, the interface is not intuitive, and closes randomly, forcing you to log back in repeatedly when you lose network connection or when it just does it on a whim. The video player is not able to minimise, which prevents you from multi-tasking, and it does not let you skip to the next episode unless you either (1) exit to the selection page or (2) skip to the end of the episode. The video player also closes on its own from time to time.",2021-04-01 11:00:03,2
Hi there!  Right up until September 7th 2022 my Disney plus app was working on my device (Samsung S10) and it now seems to not load past the welcome screen. There is nowhere to even log in as it seems to be continuously loading. I have tried clearing the cache/storage/ memory as well as updating permissions to no avail. I've also tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I'd really like to have this issue fixed immediately as my primary source for using Disney+ is via the app on my phone.,2022-09-18 04:04:51,1
"Let's be clear, the shows are awesome. But the app?! Come on, we live in an age where streaming apps have pretty clear benchmarks, and this one misses every single mark! No ""continue watching"" feature, so you have to manually search for a title each time you want to come back to it. No auto play, no user ratings, and it's search feature is super flawed. But I'm using it anyways, because Disney is awesome. I'm just gonna grumble alot while I watch my childhood favourites.",2019-11-27 15:16:48,2
"Ok but missing key features. I can't seem to find the movies or series already started. Need to recall which one I was matching, find them and recall the episode or where in the movie. I can add things to the watchlist but not remove them from it. Maybe I don't know how to use the app, but Netflix didn't need a user guide to get those features going. Neither did Crunchyroll. There are other streaming apps, I was expecting way more from Disney's... Hopefully it will get better.",2019-11-15 02:49:36,2
Had the app a week and a half. It was great loved the content. This morning it will no longer work with my chromecast. It's connected but whenever I try to play anything it just goes back to the home screen. I have tried all the usual fixes. Edit to say its got worse. I dont have any of these problems with any other streaming service. Now when it does connect there is constant buffering. Would give no stars for the app if I could.,2022-10-22 17:52:25,1
"Good selection of films, series, and shorts. everything you'll need for the Disney franchise. The only downside is the Disney + App. It is not that user friendly, compared to other streaming platforms. Similarly, the online version doesn't look great either. things that can be improved are: 1- Being able to change languages in an agile way 1- Being able to add subtitles by one click without interrupting the streaming",2023-02-26 16:44:40,2
"The app worked fine on my phone for quite a while, and then suddenly stopped. Like someone else said, I can't even get past the Disney+ symbol and first loading circle. I've updated my phone, and did the old ""uninstall, restart, re-install"" trick numerous times. Nothing works. It isn't anything related to my internet connection, because it works fine on the Chromecast. I've had this issue for over a month now.",2022-10-11 03:10:25,1
"So far I'm really loving this app! Theres this issue that, on mobile at least, when you search for a movie that isnt on here it doesnt just say no results, it shows like 40 unrelated movies and you end up scrolling through endlessly. This is definitely something that needs to be worked out, maybe by showing related titles, titles recommended based on your watch history, or by stating that there are no results 🙃",2019-11-30 03:33:07,4
"It's okay. Having technical problems though, everytime I watch something, about 10 minutes into it, the video playback just goes completely black but the audio continues to play. It's not my tv as other movie apps work and channels and stuff still display, so it's definitely disney app at fault. Have to physically get out of the show and back to the home screen, find it again and sometimes doesnt even save where you were watching from. Frustrating enough to cancel subscription and delete.",2020-03-18 09:43:58,2
Content is amazing but there are a couple bugs with the app itself. Some reason I'll come back to continue watching and it will have skipped an episode and a half when you return. Also there's no option to skip episode while watching a series you have to skip to the end before going to the next. And Where's the rest of the Mandalorian!? Content itself and the layout is brilliant with good quality streaming but some technical stuff that could be sorted.,2020-03-27 20:55:17,4
"A bit buggy (sometimes going to the next episode serves a gray screen with a blue line through the center, but you can minimize the app and rotate it to portrait, then go back in to make it normal again -- has to go to portrait mode when in the app history menu, though) but otherwise works well. The content is... Disney: they have something for just about everyone.",2020-04-10 10:51:32,4
"The streaming service is great, lots of choices for content, nostalgic and new, for any age. One thing that I don't like is, at present, you can not edit your viewing activities. This is annoying, not because I want to hide with I watch but because this service is bad for leaving finished shows or movies in your ""continue watching"" list. Or promoting you to continue mid show, episodes back from where you are. Given time it does seem to catch up and reset but it is at times annoying.",2021-04-11 17:17:47,4
"The app has room to improve to make it ""perfect"": though overall it has amazing content, the user interface is not that great. Unlike Prime and Netflix, one cannot minimise video to have it play in the background. Additionally you cannot skip to the next episode only a series, unless you either wait until the pop up comes (which is on the opposite side of where the netflix and Prime app have) or you have to exit the show and select the new episode. Some minor log-out bugs are also there. Peace ✌",2021-04-24 20:13:05,3
"Overall the content is great! There are classics, new releases and a plethera of unexpected titles on the app. However, there are small gripes many have including myself and those I have spoken to in regards to the interface. This is due to the fact you are unable to skip recaps of series nore skip the credits. The scrubbing is flawed as you select a specific time to which a severe lag is seen until the visuals reach the dialogue. The content also needs to be expanded. Other than that, love it!",2020-01-10 02:53:33,4
"Good selection of programming and an attractive appearance but the app is still very basic, even after over a year. Would love the option to play in mini player mode like I can with Netflix and Amazon so I can do other things on my phone. I am impressed with the extras included like behind scenes documentaries for a lot of the movies and TV shows. Please make the interface more user friendly!",2021-04-11 20:43:02,3
All content is fine (with the exception of the star wars sequels and the live action remakes). The app however is a bit slow and the interface is a bit annoying and frustrating. My biggest issue is when casting to chromecasts you have to make sure that the app and and the chromecast has connected and finished loading before you can cast something. It might seem like a little thing but it's frustrating when you're used to Netflix superior app response time.,2021-03-10 18:22:04,2

We deserve a better app than that Disney. Fix👏it👏.",2022-10-17 06:22:12,1

Content is amazing. Sadly the app is not. I use my internet browser instead because the app doesnt play anything. It will either try to load amd leave it on a black screen or it will stay paused on the same picture. I will be uninstalling it. Hopefully after a few updates these issues can be fixed and i can re install and change my rating. Also dont like that there is no 'continue watching' section.,2019-11-24 08:44:49,1
I hate giving bad reviews and overall the app is alright. The problem is that at least half the time I open the app or try to watch something I get errors. I finished watching an episode of a show and couldn't watch the next because of error 90 for example. The only way I've been able to Bypass the errors is by changing the country my VPN is connected to. The other problem is that STAR often will simply not show and the only way to have it as an option again is to restart the phone.,2021-04-10 14:33:33,2
"Updated: many of the below issues have been addressed! It is much better now. My first review was apparently deleted or removed accidentally. I had given it two stars before but because of the deltion and more complaints it's now one star!!

Not very accessible for those with hearing disabilities (or loud kids). Good things: content.",2020-04-29 01:06:47,4

Here I sit on a loading swirl screen everytime I try to fast forward or rewind to find my place because it never starts where it left off for me.

"It all works fine until you are playing a video and casting to Chromecast. Then you find out that the interface is sluggish to respond: slow to start playing, slow to respond to pause/rewind, and generally frustrating to use. The 'back 10 seconds' and 'forward 10 seconds' options are a joke. Also, it's not intuitive to work out how to move to the next episode in a TV show before the one you are watching has finished, or without going back to your watchlist or whatever and manually selecting the next episode. It gets plus points for being able to control it from the notification shade (are we still calling it that?) so you don't need to go back to the app all the time - but more controls there would be helpful.",2021-01-06 10:54:25,3

I have been unable to log in on my pc for 2 yrs and when you ask for help it is joke and they want you to turn off your vpn!!!!! It is not worth 79.99 a year!!!

"Navigation through the app could be easier/better, but it works fine. It is nice to be able to watch all these movies and I love that, for most of them, it has a lot of language and subtitle options. Movies are super HQ which becomes a bit annoying when trying to download to cellphone (because each one takes longer to download and uses more memory - even on lowest setting) or if my internet connection gets flaky, it keeps stopping to load. But other that that video and audio are pretty good.",2020-09-07 19:38:03,4
"I love the contents but the app's inability to play downloaded content offline is frustrating. I have followed various steps offered by numerous sites to ""fix"" the issue. Logging out, clearing cache on the app, re-installing, restarting and lots more. I think I have wasted enough time trying to find a solution to a problem that frankly, shouldn't even exist. Disney+ has been around long enough that this problem shouldn't even exist now. Please fix it so we can actually watch downloaded content",2022-08-06 23:12:46,1
"Horrible offline experience; No way to easily download the next episodes, keeps getting stuck when I go from online to offline (even through the episode is downloaded).

Only keeping it because of the series I can't get elsewhere.",2022-06-21 12:43:50,2
"Has been a great experience up until a week ago. We will try a manual update to see if it helps. Disney, if we have movies downloaded, should they still work an licencing error occurs on many and varying programs and movies predownloaded. The app spins like it is trying to load but just can't. Insights would be helpful. Thanks a million. I've been a fan of many Disney programs and movies for decades.",2022-06-17 23:49:39,4
"Don't get me wrong. I love the subscription. But this app is absolutely terrible. It crashes whenever it wants to. I'm unable to even open my profile half the time. When I download something, it gets even worse. Can't long into the profile, can't open any show, can't even delete the videos to make it work again. I've had to reinstall it so many times in order to watch anything, it's unbearable. On top of that, the downloaded series and films don't play at all. Ridiculous.",2022-10-24 21:12:47,1
It doesn't appear possible to play downloaded content without an internet connection. This makes it almost pointless to download anything in advance of a trip where you know you won't have a network signal- e.g. a daily commute on the London Underground. It also doesn't allow videos to continue playing as a minimised picture if you need to do something else on your device during playback. These two flaws make it a below average app in my opinion.,2022-08-04 06:33:54,2
"Disney is awesome. This app is horrendous, laggy, freezes, won't restart without a reboot, just problem after problem. Downloads are super slow, queue far too often, freeze, stop the app, don't resume on WiFi, it's just painful. I'll change my rating when and if these issues are addressed. Update: First impressions on app update. Slow to open. Crashes when trying to remove a download...",2020-04-04 18:02:07,1
"Apps okay but doesn't communicate with other apps. If I watch something on my tv or phone, or computer it wont remember what episode I'm on across the devices. Plus it doesn't sync with my TVs app using casting so I cant pick episodes with my phone.. Netflix does all of this seamlessly. Edit: as time goes on this annoys me more and more. Having to search for the episode I'm on every single time is frustrating. I keep getting frustrated and just watching something on Netflix instead.",2020-02-12 02:01:54,2
"it's a great app, its cheap and the amount of shows and movies is fantastic, but it's still very new so it has it's fair amount of flaws, sometimes while i scroll down it freezes, and it's not just on one deice, it's all of them! also sometimes while im searching for shows and stuff it stops typing the letters/numbers. but other than that it's a great way to watch movies and shows at an affordable price.",2020-03-19 05:28:36,4
"Streaming on Chromecast is very poor with constant stuttering and compression issues, making it difficult the. watch and enjoy anything. I have only experienced this so far with Disney+ and after reading other reviews, it seems like this is and has been a common issue. Another downside to this app is that it doesn't provide preview when scrubbing the timeline, which would be very helpful.",2022-11-12 22:34:26,1
"I expected a better and more reliable app from Disney. When downloading whole series, some of the episodes just won't play. I'm left with the spinning circle, even though the download is complete. This happens randomly and across a number of different devices. Unlike Netflix and other streaming apps, playback via the Disney+ app can't be controlled using my bluetooth speaker. If I press the play/pause button on my speaker it has no effect unlike with Netflix, BBC Sounds, Samsung Music etc.",2020-04-10 10:08:11,2
"It's alright, they need to make it easier to access and browse the app though. There is also another really annoying feature, which is that about 3/10 times you open the app, even with good Wi-Fi, it leaves you on the loading screen. This will continue to happen, even after closing and reopening the app, removing background tasks, further improving Wi-Fi connection, etc. The app will then show the loading screen, every time you open it. This only seems to stop happening about a day later.",2022-04-28 09:46:27,2
"Selection of shows is alright, but the interface is horrible. Missing A LOT of features from other streaming services like an episode selection option while watching a show (You have to go back to the main page of the show every time to jump episodes), the back button being touch sensitive across the whole screen for some reason (throwing me back to the home page for adjusting my brightness) and the autoplay window disappearing after I touch the screen and miss it by a nanometer(FFW time then).",2022-07-06 11:58:19,2
"I have the same problem as many others. The app is simply not working! Downloads are never played, it keeps loading forever, but nothing happens. Now, even when I'm connected with wifi, the home screen won't load fully. It's a catastrophy and it's been like this for months! It is really upsetting since I pay for this service and then can't use it, especially when I'm traveling. P.s. no problems with other apps (even offline). Please fix this, update the app and I am willing to give 5 stars.",2023-05-22 07:07:23,1
"Much anticipated and well worth the wait. Everything I expected and more. Great picture and interface, as well as an unexpected selection. Besides the obvious classic movies and marvel and star wars, they have amazing shows ,from darkwing duck to recess and Lizzie McGuire. The collections are great. Being able to go through Disney by the decade, all the way back to the 20s and 30s, is phenomenal. Also, since Disney acquired fox, there's even more selection like Simpsons. Also I love that the originals aren't uploaded a full season at a time. It's over too quick then forgotten about that way. Hopefully as more is uploaded you don't remove the nostalgia since that's the whole point of this service. My only points: It has a ""play"" option in each title but needs both a ""resume"" and a ""restart"" because after playing through, I can't tell what episode I left on. Needs a ""continue watching"" section, to remind me what I've recently been watching. Hard to remember all the shows and movies, as well as what episode. Just too much. Load times are a little intense but I guess it's because the platform is new. Hopefully it picks up. I'm constantly restarting the app to make it work right.",2019-11-19 01:04:57,4
The app is well made and is very user friendly. Lots of fantastic programmes and films to watch. Please never stop making The Mandalorian. On another note the connection drops a lot when popular new shows/ films are released which I believe is caused by a lot of users attempting to access same media at the same time. This causes shows to buffer and cut out which negatively affects viewers experience.,2021-01-15 14:46:51,4
"The videos randomly stop working, and then it tells me there's an error. It also tells me the same thing whenever I try to open the app sometimes. I keep having to uninstall and reinstall the app in order for it to work. This app might have almost everything on it but that point is moot if the app doesn't work. I'd have an easier time watching Netflix out in the boonies, than if I watched Disney plus right next to a wifi router.",2021-09-17 18:58:37,1
"I used it for a couple of months but I wasn't at all happy. There is a lot of content but most of it is old and watched more than a few times. (Classic Disney, Pixar and Marvel) Some FX content is very interesting and different but it's just not enough. Another problem for me is the lack of ratings which in turn helps with recommendations which are non existent. Also, both this and especially the Android TV app, crush often when starting a video.",2023-09-25 07:26:43,1
"Clearly your latest update is a disaster on your mobile app. It's been made clear by numerous reviews. Like others, I downloaded 3 movies to my phone. I'm at my farm and went to watch them and after the initial Disney page it freezes on a black screen and won't play the movie. I even struggle to get out of Disney to go to my home page when this happens. Nasty glitch. I've been lucky I've never had this problem before but do now. Please fix asap!",2022-01-16 04:40:12,1
Went to renew the app on my phone Google play auto filled my data creating a second subscription on the same account (how is that possible) and charging me £20 more than I should have paid. Google play would not refund and cancel and Disney plus said it's an obvious fault but they won't do anything about it. They also recommended I still pay them the annual subscription (in addition to the one I've just paid) to get the cheaper price.,2021-03-28 17:51:25,1
"I had this app installed on the new Google Chromecast with GoogleTV a few months ago, worked perfectly fine. I recently reopened it only to be greeted with a ""You must update the app in order to continue"" message, and when I tried to update I was met on the Play Store with the dreaded ""This app is not compatible with your device"" message. What?!? How were you compatible with the device a few months ago and you aren't now? Casting from my phone still works so it's obviously not a technical limitation! So annoying! >:(",2021-03-14 21:57:43,1
"This works great on my PC but my TV providers set top box, although it Disney+ installs fine, and the picture is great, there is no sound. The TV provider says that it is a Disney issue since all the other apps have sound. What makes this REALLY odd is that the only program I've discovered has sound is Hannah Montana (which we don't watch). No other movie or show we've tried has sound. Our only 'work around' is to cast it to the set top box from the PC which can be a pain if the PC isn't working properly. It works great on the PC.",2019-11-20 18:40:17,4
"I always get a text telling me there is some error (without an error code). Now I can't even start the app, because it claims there are network issues (but I am writing this review from my network perfectly fine). On my Ipad I can download movies to watch offline, but the error message without error code pops up when I try to play any of them, unless I am connected to the internet? App is super unstable. For mobile phones I would even say that it is completely unusable.",2021-09-12 08:09:17,1
"Good array of shows but just but an inconvenient app. Whenever I use the app on my phone it always lags just like on my PlayStation it would freeze and then return back to the time when it froze and then continue. Also my other problem is that when downloading either a show or a movie, it takes way to long to download even when my wifi is good.",2020-09-08 21:38:00,3
"This is a very good streaming service, the content is good and I especially like the extras for the marvel films, I am a huge marvel movie fan. However the mobile app has issues; it takes forever to load. I also don't like how they drop your continue to watch content after awhile or that it places a limit on watchlist content; it allows only 50 and if you add more, it drops the others. It's nowhere near as good as other streaming service but it can be.",2022-03-09 21:17:00,4
"App works on my phone, but not my android tv box. It's fairly new, android 9, but it says it is not compatible with the device. I don't have a smart tv, gaming system, and it's not offered through my cable service like Netflix. It's frustrating, as I can't even watch it using Chrome on the tv box, it just tells me to download the app. Was going to get the whole year, signed up, but if this is the case, I guess I'll cancel at the end of the trial.",2019-11-16 04:21:24,1
"All kinds of glitchy issues. Great service and I realise it's new and you'll work through bugs as they come. Shows restart on my Chromecast when I open the app. I played a show and hit cast and it just started the cast on my TV with no show. So I had to go and press play, and that didn't work. Then the app crashed. Now the app won't even open, it stays at a black screen, and crashes. Also, watching Silver Surfer, I noted when I continue watching next day, it started from episode one again.",2019-11-14 16:15:52,1
"Downloading doesn't work unless app is open and phone screen on. Should be able to download in the background. I've tried to watch downloaded content only to see an endless loading circle after the logo. It only stops if you skip forward. It happens multiple times during a video. The LG TV version's UI is clunky, unresponsive and unintuitive. You shouldn't have to highlight FF/RW to use it. It should skip 10s at a button press and hold to FF. Some Subtitles don't show for enough time or at all.",2022-06-23 19:56:57,1
"I love the series and my family enjoys it as well. Its just a shame that we cant watch it on the family tv because the app refuses to cast to our toshiba chromecast enabled television. Everytime we try, it gives a black screen. No loading, no disney logo, nothing. It also ends freezing my phone when that happens. This is literally the main way i watch anything, casting it to my tv and without that feature, this app has lost most of what i like about watching anything.",2019-11-19 14:37:36,1
"Good app and service. but now that most of Europe has the service why are certain films restricted to a few languages, i.e.: my account is Spanish, but I am not and both Frozen films, Monsters, Inc. and I don't know which others don't have more than Spanish and English, and the Engliah version is just the audio, the video is still localized to Spain with certain written elements translated. That is bad and not really an expectation from such a diverse company as Disney. Try to fix this!",2023-02-06 07:04:22,3
"Much excitement! This is fantastic!! Although a few creases to iron out - the Marvel Cinematic universe movies are not in complete timeline order (not all of the movies are even available to watch)! Was hoping for Disney songs/music too. System needs 'continue watching' function & LG smart remote wand capability. Surely these are just initial release teething issues that will be sorted out, but the first to sign-ups should have been given more than just one free week to test & provide feedback!",2019-12-01 12:06:50,4
"This app just stopped working abruptly while my 4 year old was watch a downloaded movie 2 weeks ago and hasn't worked since, even after updating app and software and unistalling and reinstalling. Tried to contact the developer and only got an email response saying that the link is no longer the correct contact info! Update your info disney!!! I just started paying more for an app that doesn't even work! If this doesn't get fixed I'm canceling my subscription! What a disappointment!",2021-08-07 01:28:25,1
"For a first launch this app seems very complete. I've been experimenting all afternoon and had a very smooth experience. Chromecast support also functions really well and operates smoothly (including changing language and/or subtitles while playing content). One thing I'd like to see is some binge watching support for series. i.e. when finishing an episode of a series, automatically start playback of the next episode.",2019-09-12 18:42:11,5
"Great interface, great selection, great everything. Until error 83 hits. I can watch Disney+ on my laptop with no problems but, whenever I try to use it on my phone I can't get past error 83 every time I try to watch something. I can see this issue cropping up in multiple other reviews as well, so this isn't a one time issue. Really needs a fix.",2020-04-13 02:53:41,2
"Great content and cheap but it can be quite glitchy for stopping playing for no reason. When you watch on the PS4 and want to type in the name of a film or TV show, the alphabet to pick letters from is in a line which is a major time wasting design flaw. It doesn't have the feature where you can see other apps and watch at the same time when watching on your phone. If these were fixed then it would be perfect!",2021-04-11 22:27:48,4
"Worst user experience ever. Freezes all the time, shows and films won't download, no matter the quality settings I choose, episodes won't resume where they left off, videos won't launch and it's impossible to navigate other apps like on Prime video or Netflix. These guys won't hire professional app developers and it shows. I'm not inciting to stream Disney's exclusive content on pirate sites, but even with ads spamming on those, the navigation would be less frustrating.",2022-01-05 06:12:47,1
"App needs work. Very inconsistent, especially when using Chromecast. Frequently just stops casting. When it switches to the next episode of a series, the play/pause etc. controls disappear. If you try to select the episode/movie you're watching to get controls to come up, it just starts playing on your device instead, while still playing on TV. Shows and movies don't always pick up where you left off and instead start over at the beginning. Ok content, but not sure if worth it long term yet.",2019-12-30 03:49:26,3
"Very slow , very buggy . On the mobile app it's slow, lagging and takes ages to load to the chrome cast. Why do we use the chrome cast and not the app on the smart TV.... Well the app on the lg smart TV is absolutely a joke! 9/10 times we are trying to use it, it takes absolutely ages . It takes around 5-7 seconds to navigate between tap when you press either a direction button or ""ok""/""select"" and ""back"" . Maybe because it's a new app it's so bad, however it has been in USA for a while now..",2020-03-30 08:47:46,1
"The app is terrible to use. The search function is really poor. You can't search categories, it's all over the place. There's some great shows but they're not easy to find if you're browsing. I stream via chrome cast and sometimes it won't recognise that it can connect to anything and I have to close & open the app multiple times. And it's ALWAYS buffering, all the time. I use other streaming services that don't have these issues with, so I don't believe it's a problem with my internet.",2022-11-19 20:47:50,1

But my God for a company that has more money and resources than some countries this app and the website is an absolute cluster F@#$! So many basic streaming service features missing!

Picking up where you left off is 50/50, might work, might not.",2019-11-19 19:17:44,2
"At first it was amazing! All of my childhood in one streaming service and then I noticed all the downsides of this app. Wifi does not work for this app on mobile at all, when going in to a video I then turn the wifi on and it seems to load and work fine but then I got a notification that my data was halfway used and when I checked it has a setting that you need to change to make it use wifi and not cellular data. But after doing this it says offline again. Not starting back until fixed!",2019-11-24 08:15:22,1
"The interface is poor. There is no 'next episode' button in the player. Let me repeat that...NO WAY to slip to the next episode. What the hell?! Even a £20 DVD player has a skip button! When you get to the credits it doesn't detect that you've finished the program. Instead, the 'continue where you left off' ""shortcut"" on the home screen takes you to the same episode you've already watched, where of course, you can't skip to the one you actually want to watch. Frustrating & painful experience",2021-04-12 12:52:00,2
"if you like staring at the loading circle and get entertainment out of seeing ""unable to connect"" or "" something went wrong"" error messages then this PAID service (by one of the richest companies in the world) is for you! In all seriousness if you want to stream content get Netflix.

Disney plus is a disgrace as a paid service.",2021-10-26 13:32:41,2
"No HDR, and the UI is terrible, especially trying to navigate subcategories, which is only possible horizontally in one stripe. On top of that, stream quality, even on HD settings, is visibly low.

"The increasing selection of films and TV programme offered on Disney+ is very good, however the apps actual set up still needs improving. In many ways the app is an early Netflix app setup, with little idea as to when next forthcoming shows will be shown, and you are unable to remove shows that you may no longer want to watch. if these functions could be added, it would help increase the overall accessibility of the app.",2021-07-22 08:49:12,4
"The content is very good. Whole original programmes are few, I really watch it for the old stuff. Issues with all Disney Plus apps is: that they don't automatically ask you if you want to resume or start from the beginning, Play icon shows when it's playing and pause when it's paused, somehow seems back to front. Not easy to get from your current programme to the series menu, without searching for it. These little things stop it from being greater.",2020-04-21 21:45:54,4
"Great content.. Awful app. Very slow and buggy. Constantly crashing. Basic functions randomly disappear or stop working altogether such as auto play and subtitles.. Extremely frustrating to use. No issues on the devices with any other streaming app, just this one. Everything has become unwatchable. For a multi billion dollar company you'd think they'd get the basics right. Should learn a thing or two from their competitors.",2021-03-01 01:00:17,1
"The app functions as intended from my experience. My only complaint, and the reason for three stars is that in the 'Manage Subscription' option in Google Play I am unable to actually manage my subscription. I had signed up during the trial and selected the annual fee, but would prefer to pay monthly (even if that isn't as economical in the long term), but there is no available option to make that change.

I just want to start by saying that I am rating the app and not the content. The content is great. The App unfortunately is very glitchy. Some days it works and some days it doesn't I have contacted the support team and on the days it does not work nothing they do has any effect. I have multiple other streaming service apps that work on the days that the Disney one doesn't. Again content is great. App is not.,2022-08-23 13:21:10,1

Only downside is that there is no option to choose the resolution at which content streams (standard, HD etc).

Even worst that the rates have just gone up, but the service got worst 😔",2021-09-19 07:03:01,2

When trying to play content saved on an external SD card, the app frequently freezes, can't load content, or shuts down. One of the worst apps created. Low functionality",2021-05-28 08:26:31,1

"Such a bad app. You can't go to your account option to cancel the subscription, you need to go in the web to login and change it. BUT the website is not made for smartphones I guess. I can't enter my account options because the PIN system is not working. I don't know who created the app or website but it reminds me of the beginning from Netflix or prime. But even them did it way better.",2021-10-16 22:51:48,1
"The number and quality of programs is great but the actual quality of the app is awful. The app often doesn't save the show from where you stopped (the smartphone app doesn't even have a stop button), many shows don't offer subtitles and some shows even discontinue the subtitle options midway through a season. Frozen screens and the app turning off suddenly aren't uncommon. Many flaws that need fixing before I'd recommend this app.",2021-12-02 13:23:51,2
Great content and love watching it. This app could do with with fixing. I have a Samsung phone and when connecting the app via chromcast it takes at least 3 goes to connect. Could the app track the episodes watched? It's so annoying to go through the catalog of episodes to find the one I'm up to. Sometimes the subtitles are not synced to the video and sound. I have reinstalled the app several times on my phone with no improvement. Pretty lame app for a multi billion company.,2021-12-19 02:20:00,2
"Generally a good app, although I feel like there could be some changes to make things more user-friendly. Sometimes there are connectivity issues where the app will suddenly close (not during videos, just while browsing), and I feel like there should be an option to ""finish"" movies. As in, once I've finished the movie I think it would be nice to have a ""skip credits"" option that removes the film from the ""Continue Watching"" list. Other than that I enjoy the app.",2021-07-19 23:04:36,4
"Very poorly set up. There is no auto play, there is no skip intro. It doesn't show how far threw an episode you are and sometimes the quality seems very low or things dont load smoothly even though I have great internet and never have issues with Netflix. Will give it a bit longer to see if these things get resolved but for the time been it's a really terrible app",2020-01-02 03:43:23,1
"Lot's of issues. Uses data to stream when watching downloaded content, confirmed by putting phone into airplane mode at which point downloads would not play. App becomes unresponsive when downloading multiple episodes (2+), says it will resume when connected to wifi but doesn't as it is connected and disconnecting and reconnecting doesn't work. Neither does restarting the app, and no option available to resume manually. I also get a black screen frequently! Terrible experience.",2020-04-02 20:55:53,2
The app via chromecast is terrible. Maybe I am doing something wrong but when I want to continue watching a movie it does not continue where I stopped watching. Seeking is real pain. Only +-10s buttons and the slider which does not show current position. When I finish watching a movie and want to see the bonuses the movie page is almost impossible to get to.,2023-04-21 18:41:08,1
"The performance within the app is alright, although sometimes the quality isn't the best. It never crashes or lags which is very comforting to know. However, recently I've been experiencing an issue with opening the app at times. It tells me that it had trouble re/connecting and tells me to reopen the app to try fix the problem. It only works when I uninstall and install the app again. However, that's the only way it can be solved and this issue has occurred more than once. Please fix this.",2021-07-08 16:19:34,3
"This app needs a lot of work, feels like it is in it it's beta testing phase or something bc it glitches often, loads very slowly and lacks a lot of features that other streaming apps have. For eg: Incorporate being able to use pop out window automatically, controlling speed, consistent skipping intro & recap for every show & being able to select or see episodes while watching and so much more. If you add intuitive features, fix all the glitches and slow loading, it can be a great app.",2023-01-31 14:18:16,2
"I live in Canada and it is a garbage App in my country. It won't work with Chrome cast as it claims. My internet is not the problem. All other streaming apps work. You tube is instant. Prime quick, Netflix connects. But Not Disney. The content looks good. Just can't get to actually play. Canceling 😞 Why pay for something you dont actually recieve? They dont even care. They make you pay a year in advance and then dont deliver or try to fix the problems. Disney+ =👎Full refund is in order.",2022-10-28 03:59:11,1
"This app is terrible. The unparalleled content is obviously why everyone will still download and pay for Disney plus, but the app is a mess. Not intuitive, glitchy, freezes all the time during streaming; all issues that more mature streaming services don't suffer from. This rating applies to the app, not the content, because the app is not the content.",2020-01-13 21:14:34,1
"I do like the fact that it has many languages and subtitles unlike Netflix which only has local ones, there is a big expat community living in Asia so I appreciate the fact that I can choose whichever language for audio or subs I wish. In the other hand though there's a bug in which you can't receive audio from any Bluetooth speaker or headphones. I already tried deleting the cache and uninstalling the app but it just doesn't work and Yes Disney Plus is the only app with this issue.Please fix it",2021-11-16 03:49:36,3

I have no issues with prime video and any other app on my devices. Not sure I will renew again with all these problems. I renewed my membership in hopes that the issues with the app were resolved. The app is still freezing or crashing no matter where I use it, Android phone, tablet and even my fire stick.",2022-12-09 13:29:53,2
Slow (especially when you compare it to say Prime Video) Often get errors or a non-stop loading animated circle where it doesn't load the video. Then I have to close and restart the app (wish as I mentioned is slow!) and try again. Or wait for another day to try again. Content is so-so. Was expecting much more and certainly a better app. Lost of room for improvement! Keeps making me log in which is really tiresome. It should recognize the device and be done with continuous authentication!,2022-12-20 02:23:29,3
"My experience with Disney+ has been okay, the content is great, but I have been having a lot issues with it. For example when you rewind 10 seconds it stops for 5 seconds then starts to play, I've been having resolution problems even though my WiFi speed and connection were on excellent, when I'm listening with Bluetooth headset there is a delay and the app has crashed several times. All of theses issues are also on different platforms like consoles and smart TVs.",2020-03-30 19:30:53,3
"Love it! It's Disney!! However, there are a few things which are not 5 stars about this app. 1. You can't cast it from phone/ tablet to tv (my tv is not compatible with Disney+ app). 2. There is no ""continue watching"" function or picking up from where you left off in a series. 3. I don't feel it's categorised to it's optimum potential - type into the search ""documentary"" and an error message comes up. Hopefully these get fixed soon as it has huge potential!",2019-11-22 10:03:27,3
"App is garbage. After 2 years I was expecting some improvement, but no, it's barely any different. It's slow to load (whether it be 5g on my phone or a decent fibre connection wired at home). Menu's are awkward and clunky, content groupings are just baffling. Loves to crash on my phone (stable on TV). Can never remember where I'm up to in a film/show or even a season. Even the login process is convoluted and frustrating. Seriously, my banking app was easier to set up. Content is great though.",2022-09-21 22:50:59,1
"It's the only app that freezes my phone...and its a damn good phone. Content? Well , for all of you that don't go to the theater ...its a great solution to have all these blockbusters right on your screen for that amount. And for us the lazy ones who don't want to ""download"" them 🙂 to see them again...and again...and again. You have a long way to go, developers.It crashes often, it eats memory, the downloads are painfully slow on a 300mb/s line etc.",2019-11-17 11:36:47,3
"The Disney+ service is ok, relatively cheap and has a good selection, but the app is not so good. It has issues connecting and loading content, casting, sometimes it just doesn't see the TV, and lacks many features when compared to the Netflix app. Edit: thanks for stealing my money and extending my subscription without as much as asking if I want to, or informing me beforehand that my subscribtion is about to expire so I get a heads-up! You are now blocked! Enjoy the last money from me!",2023-06-18 17:44:24,1
"Disney Plus has amazing shows and movies, especially from my childhood, which I absolutely love. But the reason why I am giving it a 3 star rating is because they need to fix their server. It sucks. The Disney app chooses when it wants to work on my TV. Most of the time there is a blank screen and it never loads. Its really frustrating. I never have this problem with Netflix. I Love Netflix's video server. Come on Disney, with all the money you guys make, you can come out with a better server.",2020-10-20 18:37:22,3
"Not very good with buffering times... plus I've watched several shows now and cant remember what ones as there is still no ""continue watching "" section showing up.... as well as out of all the things I've added to my watchlist... only a few are actually showing... not a very good app I'm sure it will be in a year or 2 but for now... one of the worst apps sheerly for that the content is amazi g though! Just wish I could watch it without having to reload every few minutes and says I'm ""offline""",2019-12-05 01:42:59,2
"Disney Plus itself as a concept is great, i love Disney and having everything available to me from old to new. However, the app itself is very frustrating. It tends to struggle for unknown reasons when our wifi seems fine and all other streaming apps are running ok. It has disappeared as an option now for my chromebook which is one of the main places I watched it so that's annoying. Lastly, I do not understand the download option that then doesn't let you watch offline? What is the point in this? My daughter has been very frustrated by this having spent time downloading programmes for our long trips only to find out she couldn't watch any of them - not cool!!!",2021-09-29 07:46:50,2
"Samsung Galaxy Tab S7,, + very good price for all the great content - The app is way too slow and buggy. For example, after pressing the play button, I literally have to wait 2 minutes in front of a black screen before the media finally starts - The app uses so much CPU that it forces the operating system to stop charging at a higher voltage to maintain a low temperature. This leads the charging speed to decrease so much that it's not possible to gain any charge while watching something.",2022-01-18 00:05:32,2
"Well, the content on here is great now. It has grown exponentially since launch. However... functionally, this is the worst streaming service I have used. Extremely slow and glitchy, with no improvements to that since the app became available. Seeing as Disney is such a wealthy mega-corporation, it isn't unreasonable to expect y'all would put some effort into making your app actually good. If it weren't for the content, I'd drop this service in a heartbeat.",2022-08-20 21:31:23,2
"Great app, and there's so much choice from the Disney bank of TV and films. What would improve it for me is to change the rewind option to 30 seconds; or, better yet, to be able to choose between 10, 20 and 30 seconds. I know streaming apps don't generally do this but it would be amazing. 10s is too short, in my opinion, and it's very frustrating having to repeatedly press it and wait for it to buffer.",2021-05-14 14:45:26,4
"The account is great, all I really wish was that the rewind and fast forward functions were easier to use on tv. Also there's a glitch with the app, which when you don't pay the fee it ""deletes"" your account, but when you pay the fee it will still say it's deleted and that your account doesn't exist. There's no prompt to go to the Disney+ website to fix it. Please fix this",2021-02-28 23:53:40,4
Chromecast is failing to play videos multiple times during a movie. Going from the lockscreen directly into the app sometimes crashes the chromecast playing the movie. When coming from the lockscreen phone is considerably slowed down when disneyplus is casting. Videos don't start playing at the point where you stopped watching before making it necessary to find the point in the movie manually after a crash. Design of the app is really nice. Still some start up problems..,2019-09-20 18:50:15,2
I was really excited about using this app. Unfortunately I cannot download it onto my Android box since it says that my device isn't compatible. Nor can I watch it on the browser you literally need to have the app. I think that the platform would be amazing if things like this could get fixed and not everybody has a phone or tablet or firestick some cases you want to be able to watch on a normal browser and maybe you can't afford to get a new device so you need to be able uses on older devices,2019-11-13 21:51:42,1
"Wow Disney. I'm glad my subscription is free at the moment. Sooooooo many bad reviews. I don't really feel like watching movies on my phone thanks. When I open Google Home to connect to my TV, the best I get is sound only, and have to watch the picture on my phone. I don't have this issue with ANY OF THE OTHER STREAMING SERVICES. A couple of months ago, this service was working fine. At the end of March I won't be paying for a subscription if this hasn't been fixed.",2022-12-08 06:37:52,1
"Unbelievably glitchy with chromecast. This started a few months back. Before then functionality was fine. To get it to work now you have to load the app on data, then connect to wifi, connect Disney to chromecast, close app, disconnect wifi, load media on phone or tablet using data, then connect to wifi and then during streaming to device connect to chromecast again. Insane!",2022-11-27 02:09:49,1
Content is great but the app its self is very poor. Slow. Unresponsive. Cuts off. Just a poor app the star are for the content only. This review has been edited 7 months after I left the original and all the problems are still there and some of them even worse. They have had more then enough time to sort this app now. This is why I'm cancelling. I wanto to be able to tune on and watch withing the minute not press a button and wait for the app to catch up. Shocking app. Absolute garbage,2023-06-01 21:48:56,1
"Way behind competition. It does not show currently Playing list. You have to go to your profile to find your wishlist, and it does not cast in surround sound to Chromecast with either the phone app or a computer. Doesnt remember till where you played and you have to seek every time. It's a shame because it has so much of content that I like. The suggestions also do not match what you see. I bought a subscription through a promotion at a couple of dollars a month, and still would not pay for it.",2023-09-20 00:13:00,1
"Any movie I choose loads for ages and then when it does load the screen turns pink and only plays audio, I've tried logging out, and deleting the app but it doesn't work. -edited- after fixing that problem the app caused my phone to crash multiple times and it seems to be freezing the screen and continuously rebooting the phone. Just wandering if it's even comparable with the Oppo phone.",2019-12-31 09:53:44,1
"Continually locks up. Unresponsive searching. Profile pin set to off but still asking for pin. Downloads that are also unresponsive cannot dismiss or remove. Whole app appears very stuck. App setting page will not load. When I was able to download a film, it took 10 minutes to start playing. I would have expected a lot better from a company like Disney. Very disappointed with the Android app experience. One star is too much but could not give anything less. @Netflix and @Prime apps far superior",2022-12-24 15:23:27,1
"Finally something were you can watch every Disney movie and series, but you have to skip an amount of time when a episode is finished so you can press the continue button.

There wasn't resume anymore it was just play.",2020-03-25 17:09:47,4

"It is a very good app but whenever you exit out of it and come back the movie freezes but the audio continues, or if you stop watching for a bit and come back it doesn't save where you were at, and something I recommend is a ""continue watching"" area so you dont have to scroll through all the movies and go throughout the movie to go back to where you were, other then that it's great.",2019-12-10 00:36:01,4
"When it works, it's great. Easy to use and navigate. When it doesn't work, it's annoying. Really annoying. Constantly signs me out even in areas with good to great wifi and coverage. Offline play of downloaded episodes works sporadically and even when it works the player often stops dead mid-episode for no reason I can fathom, often resulting in being signed out again, which means that I have to find an area with coverage or a wifi connection to sign in and the whole cycle starts again.",2021-05-12 19:02:28,2

"Overall okay. I don't like the way my watch list is buried. There is also a bug where if you begin playback with subtitles already enabled (from a prior session), they are ahead of the audio.

"8/10 times there is a lag when opening the app. Sometimes the lag is long and the app freezes and doesn't open. The groupwatch is very innovative, and even Netflix didn't implement it. It needs further polishing, however. Enable invitation of previously invited guests through the TV apps. It is annoying and time-consuming to resend invitations every time it disconnects or we change episodes. There is also a lag, one person's video is always between 2 and 5 seconds behind.",2021-02-27 08:31:59,4

No problem. Also doesn't keep track of last position in a program If it crashed. Addition of Star is nice. Update: Near the end of the year and it will still claim I input the wrong pass half the time even though it has never changed. Unacceptable.",2021-12-04 16:07:16,2

Disappointing.",2020-01-31 21:04:17,2
"Sucks, I can't cast to my Vizio SmartTV! Also, missing some basic functionality: Such as ""continue watching"" section, that Netflix has.

I refuse to give my money to organizations whose only interest is indoctrination and race division I watch TV to escape the vary BS that Disney and hulu are trying to promote get back to making TV and get off the political stage. I was willing to let it slide when it was only once in a while I'd come across the trans or gay stuff at this point its just trying to force people into their beliefs and it's wrong and disgusting!,2024-02-14 06:11:29,1

This movie just came out today. Excellent movie that I've already watched 4 times. I will be adding this to my collection when hopefully it comes out on DVD. The actors are so AMAZING!! You can actually feel their emotions. What a FANTASTIC heart-warming movie!!! I LOVED IT and will keep watching it. Thank you so much Disney!!!,2023-12-02 02:21:22,5

"Good content, bad casting experience. Rewinding is a nightmare, it takes 10 seconds to go back 10 secs so you end up in the same place? So to go back 30 sec I pause, then hit -10 once, wait for it to load, it might stay paused in which case I hit -10 again, or it might start playing in which case I hit pause, and then -10 again, and so on. Or I could try my luck with the slider, but its so small you can't navigate to the right spot. Its just easier to watch via the app on my phone",2023-04-26 13:13:24,1

I had to put my TV volume up to 56 and it was still difficult to hear. Additionally, the picture quality was absolutely horrible. I thought it was an isolated issue on that day but subsequent attempts yielded the same results. Now I'm out $13.55 for less than 2 hours use.

"I have no problem with Disney plus itself, but the app is very difficult to navigate. When going through media you cannot swipe left or right through the movies because it registers it as swiping up or down, this means if it's not on the first three movies within a category, you must search it up. This prevents someone from discovery new movies or shows, and can only watch what they know is on there via search.",2019-12-16 18:16:57,2
"The Disney+ content is amazing but the interface is mediocre. Content disappears from my ""Continue Watching* after a few days. It gets annoying to continually have to find the show again and navigate to where I left off. There have also been a couple of shows that don't automatically queue up to the next episode when the prior one finishes. Also, it would be nice if the back and forward buttons could be customized to something other than 10 seconds.",2021-10-08 19:51:22,4

If you think Disney+ is bad I don't know what's wrong with your phone but it has all types of good films for kids. It has wonderful features and is so creative and now it has been working for 100 years! that's quite amazing I personally wouldn't give it a one.,2023-12-21 19:35:42,5

"While this is the only place to stream Disney, the UI leaves something very much to be desired. Menu navigation is frustrating and tedious, and it is a challenge to find where you were in a series if an episode skips (which happens far too often).

"The UI when using the Disney+ app with chromecast is barely functional. The skip forward/back buttons are laggy and sometimes ignore you pressing them. It often forgets the actual position you stopped watching an episode at. The app often desyncs with your phone, meaning you basically lose all control. There are just so many small, frustrating problems with this app. Even ""free"" apps like Tubi don't have as many problems.

"I think it's a good start to what could be a great app. Obviously the library is there, and that's what's keeping most people attached, however it is missing key features that users have come to expect after years of using streaming services like Netflix and Stan. For example, not being able to clearly see which episodes of a series you have watched and which are new can be very annoying. Also the large episode cards shouldn't be more important than the short episode descriptions!",2019-12-11 22:20:00,3

Altogether ok. Content is great (as can be expected). Issues include but are not limited to: 1. Insistence on providing all the credits before moving to next show 2. When watching with headphones on a tablet sound is delayed and out of sync to lip movement 3. When a film is watched it remains as not finished because I never watched the credits 4. Scrolling through and browsing the options are not always intuitive 5. Lag and ease of use forwarding and rewinding,2023-01-16 07:48:44,3
"The content is good, but the app just doesn't live up to todays' standards. Every time the video starts buffering, the only ""fix"" is to exit the video, and start it again, often resulting in going 10-20s ""back in time"". There's no ""Skip recap"" feature, no way on the Chromecast to skip to next episode instead of having to wait. Hoping the app gets some improvements, cause it could be really good.",2021-03-02 08:55:27,2

"Decent movies, decent shows. The service itself I have no problem with. It's how that service is executed - the app - which is the problem. Specifically, downloads. If you have an option to download shows and watch them offline, you would expect to ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO WATCH THEM OFFLINE. yet whenever I go to put on a pre-downloaded show the app responds with a loading screen (at best, sometimes it just shows a blank screen). What's more, nothing is being done about this. The Devs have ignored it",2022-06-14 19:30:56,1
"Great content, horible app and experience. 1. Had issues buying the subscription in the first place which the support blamed on the bank and just magically managed to buy it two days later. 2.

An option to download content. Brilliant. BUT you cannot watch said content when offline. Where is the logic?",2022-08-21 20:45:27,1
"Missing some features, but great value. It could really do with more robust tracking (so you can see how much you've viewed, like Netflix & YouTube have).

"I will start with the positive. It has amazing content, much better than all other competitors. First negative is how slow it is. For example it feels the need to reload the homescreen everytime you go off it, even if you were on just on it which is stupid and an easy fix. Downloads take ages to download for whatever reason and are buggy. The UI is pretty rubbish. It is the opposite of slick and looks bland. I could rant for hours but I only get 500 characters.

While other are perfectly fine? Doesn't make sense.",2019-11-13 08:57:10,4
"Not too much impressed with the app. Downloaded a bunch of movies only to find out that none of them were playing. The offline feature of Netflix works much better for me. Also I find the selection of content still ab bit limited. Premier access to blockbuster movies is unreasonably expensive from my perspective. Who pays $34.99 to watch a mediocre movie at home from the couch?! Come on Disney thats insane, I wouldn't pay that much to see it in a cinema on a big screen.

Instead of letting you skip multiple times before trying to reload it tries reloading and syncing every 10 second step. Trying to go back 30 seconds is practically impossible.

Switching shows usually doesn't work, have to stop all casting, reconnect and select new show. That gives you 80% success rate.

Sometimes I can get them to work but most the time its a big fat nope. I always make sure they download completely and sometimes I'll use data, if I'm in cell range, to log in and it'll work but more than half the time it doesn't.

An option to remove from continue watching would be good.",2019-12-19 10:24:45,4

Also, there is not a continue watching section so you have to look for the show you want to watch again and again; and once you find it, you have to remember what was the last episode you watched. Good content though.",2019-11-15 11:39:10,2
"I, as most people, was annoyed (but understanding) of the fact that they made viewers that received the app on the 24th of March wait for series that had already fully came out in America. I hope they do not make the same mistake for the summer release. I also wish that the app had a mini player for phones as it is very hard to do anything while watching a show/movie. Other then this, I have loved the app so far. Thank you.",2020-04-23 14:44:03,4
Good price. Good content. Issues that need to be resolved - No Picture in Picture for Android at least so youre watching Disney+ and nothing else - Even if you download content often you will get the weak wifi error and the content will not play. If you turn your data on the content will play but it still uses data. This is a really bad issue in my opinion.,2021-07-04 15:24:00,2
Desperately needs and option to remove shows and movies from Continue Watching.,2024-04-19 13:05:26,4
Good content but a couple issues. Going back in a video will cause delay since it freezes when I go back. This is a big issue since it takes like 6 seconds before to the visual content starts playing as the sound starts immediately. Downloading is slow. It often says I'm not connected to WiFi when I am. Maybe Disney needs to add settings that gives it higher priority access to bandwidth when downloading. Lastly add The Simpsons as an original. I want to watch the episodes as they come out!!!!!!!,2020-02-02 16:24:53,3
The choice of programmes is great. Had the app on my tablet over a year with no issues. About 1 week ago I tried opening the app to watch a programm and it came up saying not connected to the Internet when I was (managed to get on Google and Netflix with no issues). I've uninstalled the app twice and reinstalled to see if that fixed the issues but it hasn't. I've had a look and I'm not the only one experiencing this issue. It needs to be fixed!! Hate paying for something which doesn't work.,2023-08-04 21:00:25,1
"This review is for the app only. As far as content goes on Disney+ it's great, love it. So far no problems with the app, until today... Today I was using the app, and the blue circle started to load, had problems. then the app froze, I couldnt' click my home button, power button nothing. the screen literally had a blue circle on it for 3 hours, tried everything to restart phone. I can't pull my battery out of my samsung phone so it just got hot and eventually the phone restarted. So seems to be issue with freezing app and loading issues.",2019-11-29 02:51:01,3
"LAG LAG LAG!!! You would think that a company as large as Disney would spare no expense in the unveiling of their new streaming service and ensure zero lag.. it lags to start a show or movie, you are lucky to get 10 minutes in without it laging again. Trying to watch The World According to Jeff and the thing freezes every 45 seconds for about 10 seconds and keeps doing it... Very comparable to Kodi or a terrible off brand online streaming service. Glad I didn't cancel Netflix...",2019-11-16 02:21:49,1
"I'm getting pretty close to unsubscribing simply because this app is constantly buffering. I'm literally watching a 20min episode and the blue ring is in the screen regularly. Not to mention, the price has just gone up but the app hasn't improved with the recent update. 🤷 It's disappointing because the content is good, but if I can't get through one episode without it stopping, it's not worth it.",2022-11-19 03:16:39,1
"Processors are slow when it comes to downloading movies, and or, tv shows on to an android phone. Doesn't matter what speed of Internet I've used, downloads take a while, and you also need to be on the app itself, or the download connection drops out. I've noticed, staying on app when downloading helps keep from connection dropping out, but draw back is, drains phone battery having to stay in app. Otherwise, its an epic app, I love having all the favourites in one spot.",2020-12-31 02:19:45,3
"IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH ANYTHING! App is literally broken, constantly get (Error Code 39). No solution is available, reinstalling, clearing cache & data, turning on & off, signing in & out...

Seems to be an issue after Android 11, but Disney is too incompetent to update their app.",2022-10-12 03:30:38,1
I like all the movies to watch with friends and family and some of the funny movies but I just hate that we have to subscribe,2024-03-02 19:36:01,4
It's a nice app it has a lot I'd good movie but when I'm on my phone it just says sorry I new version of Disney needs to. Be updated accept or decline and if I press decline then it kicks me off the app🙃.,2024-02-03 17:52:36,3
"EDIT - now the app does not work with chromecast at all. No error code, just tries to launch and crashes. Spend ALMOST 2 HOURS with tech. Nothing. This app is the worst. Constantly hiccups and loses control of Chromecast. No problems with Netflix, BritBox, YouTube, amazon, but with Disney, trying to cast is a nightmare. Want to pause and rewind? Forget it! It's not worth the hassle! The content is great. Simpsons. X-files, what we do in the shadows? All great. But the app, it's the worst",2023-05-04 23:19:46,1
wonderful movies and I always can find something I love and enjoy watching. thanks for the wonderful experience and God bless you,2024-04-07 15:30:50,5
"Chromecast connectivity has been degrading over the last year. It can take up to 15 attempts (including reseting the phone, chomecast, switching eifi on and off) and up to 20 mins to successfully stream something (connecting is ok, streaming fails). Very very frustrating as this is the only streaming app that I use that has this problem. Netflix, Stan, Kayo, Prime, Hayu, all work fine. Considering cancelling my subscription if this cannot be resolved. Just not worth the frustration.",2022-11-15 01:24:58,1
"The content is great. But the app is just ridiculous.. No way to skip episodes correctly, when the season ends (Simpson for example) the prompt to continue watching is not there anymore. It's like the devs just gave up in the middle of it. It's also very laggy and certain times the app just stop working with unintuitive error message. I'm a software engineer and this is just a big joke and yet again we can see that Disney is overrated. They won't give you good apps, they just want to make money",2020-03-23 20:18:25,2
This app was great until recently. It has stopped working on my phone. I have deleted and reinstalled it many times and i have even deleted apps for storage just in case . But no. Still wont work. My wifi is fine so i dont know the problem...? Sometimes it will play the sound with a black screen or play the video with no audio? Please fix this.,2021-03-20 15:59:20,2
"Takes for ages to download (wifi runs great, no problems as I double check) just takes it's time. Most episodes, movies I do download dosent even allow me to play yet the rest does. Would love to have an easier way to unsubscribe, would love for it to be able to stream in background (minimise) as I use other apps. Other than that, im glad I can access the shows I want to see as it saves searching and having to open and close tabs etc",2020-03-23 07:07:09,1
"Want to give it 5☆ as the potential this app has is great and well worth subscribing. However there are 2 major issues: It takes about 10 minutes of reloading to start an episode of anything on my tablet, which is extremely frustrating. Also, when I play it on my xbox it usually loads but even then is glitchy during the videos. Desperately needs some work, which shouldn't so badly be the case for such a big company, but I have high hopes for the future. Enjoyable app, 10/10 when it runs smoothly",2020-11-24 00:21:01,3
"This app started off great, but over the last few months has become terrible. It takes multiple attempts for me to login because the app won't recognise my correct pin after multiple attempts. I can no longer watch any of my downloaded content, for some reason. And even when trying to stream content, I constantly get network error messages, when there is no issue at all with my WiFi network. Whatever has changed recently, please change it back. This app is now a buggy and unusable mess.",2022-12-18 22:23:02,1
"Excellent selection of TV series, movies and documentaries. Disney Plus still doesn't have the functionality of picture-in-picture (minimise the size and still watch the program). The other Streaming services had this very basic ability for years, but Disney still lags behind. This function is controlled by the Android operating system, but Disney refuses its users the capacity. Picture-in-picture is essential for a 5-star rating.",2023-08-12 21:43:18,2
"I can't get into the sign in page. Every time I open the app to sign in, I am faced with the loading screen. I've tried clearing the data in storage settings, Uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Nothing works. I can open it on my other devices just fine but it just doesn't want to budge on this device. Could you please fix this? And thank you",2022-07-05 01:59:03,1
"Streaming to Chromecast is very unreliable, as every movie or TV show stops several times. Have used direct ethernet, wifi and at different locations on different devices. The app also freezes occasionally, so watching is a problem. Downloading multiple shows is buggy, but one show at a time seems okay. Nerflix, Stan and Amazon Video stream flawlessly. Disney+ is a frustration to use. It doesn't matter how good the content is, if you can't watch it. Disney+ is really disappointing.",2020-01-19 10:21:04,1
"Not sure if it's because of the first day of launch, but I downloaded a movie to watch online on my commute and I have sound but not video. I have a pixel 2, so not sure what's wrong. Hopefully it's fixed soon, but bummer first experience. **Update: fixed and works perfectly. Great app and library.",2019-11-27 03:16:04,4
"Have yet to find a platform where Disney+ works. On the PS4 is freezes and skips constantly, which is better than the app on the Play Store. It won't even connect, giving me the connection issue error. The one time I was able to get past it and try to log in, but it gave me the connection error again. Awful experience all around. I don't recommend it in any form or on any platform until Disney works this out.",2020-01-22 16:55:12,1
"Only place to watch certain shows and movies, but it's poorly ran app. If a show/movie is paused at all (ex. To answer a text) you must close the whole app before before playing the same title again. If not, you get constant error messages. The suggested titles on the main page are random/not tailored to individual interests (no shame, but I don't want to watch the Kardashians, but their new season has been heavily pushed on me for months). Overall, a frustrating experience every time.",2023-10-14 13:26:04,2

"The app and service over my cell data service is non existent if I am on the low data speed unlike Netflix which works great, additionally there is no setting to have the app float over another app that I may wish to use whilst I have a show on. The Netflix app allows me to have the app on at a small size above the webpage/book/weather I may be reading. I rarely watch Disney because of this inconvenience.",2022-05-22 21:55:57,2
Used to work really well. But now the app rarely connects to our Chromecast properly for viewing. Often buffers a lot if it does connect with the big blue circle rotating in the middle of the screen. That's when it actually connects. Am very disappointed with this app currently. It needs to be fixed. Have superfast fiber broadband and should not be experiencing these issues. Netflix works perfectly.,2023-01-08 22:26:59,1
"It's a great app,... For watching movies for five days. I downloaded the app so I could watch my favorite shows on Disney offline. It was working great. After a week or so the app would just load ages and it wouldn't even let me watch anything. I just get a black screen. I repeadetly deinstalled and reinstalled the app but it doesent fix the problem. Please fix this problem Disney. It's a great app. I would give it 5 stars if I wouldn't have this problem.",2022-01-09 06:40:37,2

"I have to voice my concerns for the Disney+ app on my Fire TV Stick. If I get to hit play, before everything loads, it tends to quit completely. When I hit pause, it takes a while to pause (video stops but sounds keep playing for a few seconds before it comes to a full pause) and same when hitting back to go back to the home screen (Dinsey+). I am only experiencing this lag on this app. Not sure, if it is heavy on resources and the Fire TV cannot handle it but it works flawlessly on my phone.",2020-11-03 03:09:15,1
"Absolutely terrible app! It keeps crashing. Error 83 message. And yes, of course I rebooted the device and check that it is compatible. After I accessed from 2 smartphones, 1 tablet and 1 smart TV... It gives me the same troubles, except that on my TV, I can only see the home page, that's it. No movies or episode will load.

I have Fibre internet, Netflix, Amazon, neon & tvnz/TV3 all work fine, no issues when casting. Too expensive to keep for an on again off again service.",2023-03-04 23:29:07,1
"The app is ok. The navigation of it sucks though. For example, I followed everything the ""help section"" of the app and website told me to do yet I can't update or delete my billing information because that's the only option not there. When you watch a couple episodes and come back the next day to watch more of it, it doesn't continue where it left off. You have to go through every episode to try and choose which one you left off at to continue watching.",2019-11-19 18:51:47,1
"Extremely disappointed with the Disney App, not the content just the UI. There is no screen/keyboard lock so when my daughter is watching movies she can knock the buttons and stop the movie, not great when you're driving and can't fix the issue. Netflix has a screen lock why can't you! Also, thr stupid app logs out when off WiFi! What's the point of downloading movies for off-line use if you then need to connect to internet to log in! This is pointless when you're out of reception range 🤦",2021-04-16 23:46:08,1
Amazing content but won't cast to my brand new TV. The app face will cast but when I try watch something it turns to a black screen with sound playing. No feature to pick up where you left off or no recently watched. It's a shame cause the content is well worth the subscription.

It does NOT accurately keep track of what episode of a show I'm on, if I'm casting to my tv I can't skip intros and I have to wait a ridiculously long time before it starts the next episode, on the desktop version I can't figure out how to select a different episode of a show I'm watching from the homepage, I can't remove things from the 'currently watching'-list... Quite expensive for an app this bad, especially compared to Netflix.",2022-03-28 23:51:44,2
"The actual Disney+ is great, the app not so. The actual streaming service is great, with a lot of content for the entire family, but the app itself is a let down, mostly when downloading. If the app closes while downloading a film, it screws up the download and you have to delete it and start again. I currently have an issue where I have to download episiodes individually, because it messes up otherwise. Additionally, I can't get the app for Windows. This is really disappointing.",2020-05-03 10:17:43,3
"The movies and shows are worth the money. However, the app itself is a piece of junk. I got the app when it first came out and have been waiting to review it, because it is expected for it to not be great to start. Even after updates, the continue watching bar is sometimes there, and sometimes not. It automatically plays the next episode on my tablet but not my phone? The app is just broken. Hopefully with a few more updates they will get this all fixed. But as of right now the app itself sucks.",2019-11-29 13:22:23,2

It takes forever for your movie to start playing, and once it does, you'll get an error message saying something went wrong, and you'll have to start the struggle all over again. I tried reinstalling the app and even downloading the TV series or movie I wanted to watch in the hopes of improving playback, but it didn't help. After the fifth restart of the app or tv series/movie, you get tired of struggling and just go to Netflix/Stan or free tv...it's a lot less work. It is a shame...Disney Plus have great movies and shows. Please fix your app.",2022-02-25 08:22:36,3

I have to reset everything just to get it working again, just to find that the film is half an hour back from where it was, or I'm now two episodes backward.

"Lots of good content, but not great for three reasons: First not all the classic movies are available as i tried to watch The Boatniks but it was not available as many others were not. Second if you think that you will have access to the 20 Century Fox library (Disney owns it) as i did, forget it because they only have an handful of their movies available.

Doesn't show me anything different or interesting. No Disney plus, I don't want to watch how I met your mother I really wish that when I switched to a different app, the video would keep playing in a smaller screen",2022-11-19 16:46:06,1
"I really love the service and app. The only thing that really annoys me is that for some movies, certain dub and sub languages are unavailable even though they exist. For example, I'm in Canada and for some movies (especially CG animated ones like Zootopia and Tangled) I can't watch them in Brazilian Portuguese, but if one access it from Brazil, the language option is there. Even changing the app language to Brazilian Portuguese doesn't make any difference.",2021-03-13 16:03:07,4

Before, I'd have to click retry on a screen that said no connection, clicking on the show/movie that I wanted to watch, wait for it to tell me to try again later, then click on it and have it work (no turning your screen off or exiting, bc that's resetting the process again). Now, I can't watch anything. I'm clearly typing this with connection, so why can't I get to the first screen?",2022-04-17 02:43:51,1

The App needs work. Many features found in Netflix that this app is missing or does not incorporate properly yet. 1. Autoplay doesn't always work. 2. App won't remember where I left off in a season I'm watching. I have to remember the last episode I watched. 3. Watchlist is shared with all profiles. What's the point of having separate profiles? 4. Poor organization of titles. I know this app is new but we're not taking about reinventing the wheel here.,2019-11-19 19:54:41,3
Works well for me when streaming. Annoying to have to login multiple times a day especially if I'm off-line and so am locked out from watching downloaded content. Navigation is so-so and not so great at finding content. Not the worst app out there but they should hire some proper UX/UI designers and testers to make it less frustrating to use,2021-03-02 13:37:44,3
"Content is what you'd expect. The app is lacking some (imo) obvious quality of life features competitors like Netflix etc. have integrated in their respective apps. For example, there's no way to adjust screen brightness in app, you have to adjust the phone's general brightness. Downloading Episodes/movies is practically impossible for me, download speed is ultra slow even with good connection and downloads will pause for no apparent reason. Downloads can be paused, but not resumed out of app.",2022-04-23 17:19:13,2

"The content is ok. They need to do something about the sound. Every other streaming app only needs me to turn it up to 20 to get it loud enough to hear general dialogue. On Disney plus I have to turn it up to 76 on the sound bar. It is like this both on a chrome cast and smart tv. Do better disney!

"Loving Disney+ and all the content but one thing that needs to be changed is the language preferences for Canadian viewers. We are not all fluent in French and therefore should be able to choose between Canada (English) and Canada (French). It's a pain watching movies like Star Wars where the intro to the plot is in writing and it's all in a language you cannot read, and there's no option to change it!

This app needs to be fixed asap!! I downloaded a movie so I can watch offline; I made sure to put in my setting streaming only on wifi so it does not use any cell data. This all ignores that movie is downloaded as well as the settings of wifi only and streamed the movie over my cell data. I even confirmed when I put my phone on airplane mode and the movie stopped playing. In total it used over 900 MB of my data!! Not happy!,2019-12-17 18:27:03,2
Great app! Works perfectly fine! every now and then it freezes but besides that it's a great app. Has some bugs like restarting the movie when you go back too it after leaving and buffering a lot but if you have a good internet connection should work perfectly work. Great app where I have a large variety of movies or shows too select. Great for car trips and movie nights where you can watch the good classic Disney movies. 10/10 would recommend. This keeps me entertained for hours absolutely love it. If you have Disney+ and Netflix it is the best combo! Good job Disney!,2020-02-03 06:52:03,5
"Too many errors and bugs. Frequently refuses to load pages or play a film. Recently my main TV started stuttering when playing and refusing to play with a Code 39 Error. No other streaming app is having these problems. Epic fail. A year later, no improvement whatsoever, and in fact in some ways it has gotten worse. WAKE UP, DISNEY!",2022-09-10 08:23:09,1

"Good app, works relatively well and it is what is says! One main drawback for me is that I can't minimise and continue watching while (for example) checking text messages like you can with similar apps like Netflix and Prime. EDIT: Has gotten quite better across multiple platforms, although I'd like for the title to go to episode list/menu when clicking from ""continue watching"" rather than jumping right in.",2021-04-09 22:09:22,4

"Horrible! Sometimes the cast option works sometimes it doesn't! The continue watching was only available for a day and has no disappeared so I have to search for everything I was watching! The next episode options don't work! The count down will appear but then it just stops playing. In this case I have to restart, re-cast and replay the episode. Fix the app!",2019-12-01 02:40:59,1
"The app keeps glitching! While scrolling through movies to see what is available the app constantly bounces back to the top of the screen, meaning there is no way to actually see all the movies that are available because you can't get to the end of the list. Very frustrating. Tried to see a full list of movies on the website, but it won't let me do anything except go to the app. Please fix this, it is making the app impossible to use.",2020-01-25 10:44:06,1

"It's great that Disney has their own streaming service with all of their movies and shows and all of the movies and shows from other companies they've bought. The app could use a few more features, like a continue watching list for movies you haven't finished yet, but overall pretty good. 5 stars when it has a continue watching feature.",2019-11-25 17:03:25,3

"Basically unusable with Chromecast 1st Gen. Constant buffering, or failure to cast. Accumulating delay between the stream and captions. By the way - no problems with connection or hardware.

"For a company as successful as Disney I would have expected a bit more from the UI. What really drives me nuts though is that when you tap the screen to hide the fine controls after using them, half the time your video stops and you end up back at the menu screen. It's infuriating and so unnecessary given that there's an arrow you can tap in the fine controls that would do the same thing, so why exactly is half the screen dedicated to that same purpose?",2023-05-02 12:47:56,1

"Not a bad app. Works pretty much like Netflix so that's a good thing. Content is amazing of course although it's PG-13 and no higher! 4k and HDR 10 plus the ability to stream to 4 devices simultaneously (at no extra charge) is definitely a huge plus!! And also the yearly plan at just $89 can't be beat. There is a few bugs atm tho, it's to be expected as demand has been much higher than they thought.. so it can freeze and the quality can drop significantly....hope this gets sorted soon.",2019-11-19 02:22:37,4
"Less issues with the app not working, but it needs a feature to remove titles from the continue watching line. And the continue watching line should be right at the top",2024-01-26 18:35:00,3

"It's got issues, would be great if it worked properly though, at the moment we can't get it to play on our tv (brand new hisense) it did play one movie then stopped, and the app on my phone will occasionally let us watch something usually one movie then stop functioning, Maybe they'll sort it out soon.

I've reinstated and uninstalled it more times to count, and each time it works fine once before the error message pops up. again. Honestly, I'd give it four stars but this just sucks :/ plus, the downloads aren't real downloads.

"Disney plus has great content lots of options to choose from for young to old! Plus very good video audio quality. Unfortunately, it lacks the user friendliness of other streaming apps like Netflix to skip episodes (have to fast forward all the way to end, to get to the next) nor does it have the option to remove content from your continue watching section. Only things that let this app down",2022-11-27 15:58:30,3
"I think the entertainment service is very satisfactory and complete, I mean, It's Disney, but I found a technical problem: the Disney app doesn't allow doing the MirrorShare (To share from the cell screen to the Tv screen), which means I can't transmit Disney+ from my cell phone to my Tv. To be exact, the TV screen gets black. I'd like Disney to fix it or change it because some TVs don't have the option of downloading apps but do the MirrorShare option.

Also, I wish this website had a ""continue watching"" section. I dont see one on here and I'm tired of looking up the series I'm watching. But other than that it's good",2019-12-01 17:31:14,3

At some point into the movie the lip sync goes out, it stops playing, buffers, then plays again after 20secs, at terrible quality then gets quality back but lip sync goes out again. So frustrating. Not sure if it's a streaming thing that Australia can't handle, but I'd rather buy the movie directly via apple then download this app. What a waste of money.",2020-08-31 02:31:59,1

"As a service this is an easy A+. The UI is clean, the range of shows is excellent, and the app works flawlessly. Even the addition of the extras tab is great. But there are a few things that stop this from getting a perfect rating: 1. Unnecessary censorship 2. Huge swathe of missing episodes in certain shows. 3. Disney+ originals being far too safe and predictable. If you care for cinema then choose Netflix or Stan. If you need something for your children then Disney+ will do the trick.",2019-12-23 02:25:36,4
"Clean overall design but needs filtering options on the watchlist, even simple ones like filtering by Movie or tv series. I can't see why extra filtering options like sort by length or release date aren't a standard with every streaming service now, as it would be so useful. Netflix is probably the best with the ability to just see a certain genre in your list but that's it really. Hopefully Disney+ adds something like this soon!",2020-03-24 23:57:50,3
"Worked well for a while but since the new update where they introduced the advertisement screens when casting nothing works. Movies cut out halfway, error codes when loading anything, tv series don't autoplay anymore, it even causes the whole Chromecast to shut down and restart.

As a father of two, my kids are having a ball with all the content As a Marvel fan I'm having the best time ever :) The app works great as far as I've tried...

Keep it up",2019-09-14 05:09:18,5
"Because Disney owns everything! They have most of my favourite shows and films, they have everyone's favourite shows and films because they own everything now.

It crashes, its glitchy, it doesn't remember where you're up to in yours shows, if you get a notification the screen goes black, if you leave the app mid episode and then go back the screen freezes for 10 seconds while you can still see sound. You could call it teething issues but this app has been out for months in America, the fact that it's this bad on release day after being out so long in America leads me to believe they won't be fixing it soon",2020-03-31 12:09:16,2
"UI not the best or I'd give 5 stars. Episodes of series don't play automatically on Chromecast so you have to go on to your phone to play the next episode manually. Hard to search for films. Also documentaries should have its own menu with subcategories, it's too broad a media device to just be within the movies menu. Then you can put docu-series and documentaries together.

Awful!!!! I have been watching it since it started and now it doesn't work. The app was bad but was starting so its bound to have issues. It gives me some nonsense that the app is not available in my location. It was last night! Is not easy to use. Doesn't have the option to continue watching.

"Generally it's pretty good. Quality is great. Range of shows/movies is amazing. The only thing I don't like (and it really annoys me hence the low rating) is the lack of link between your downloads and your live stream i.e. if you download something to watch while you are offline, why doesn't it then sync when you're back on line so you can watch from where you left off?",2023-10-18 13:47:21,2
Very disappointed that this is only compatible with newer devices. My daughter has Netflix and Amazon Prime video on her Samsung galaxy S3 lite (bought it this year from Costco) and use them with no issues but this app is not compatible.

It doesnt matter if you store it to internal or external storage. Also the app is stop working after you try to play a downloaded movie. Force stop, clear data, reinstal etc. does not help all the time. Really needs an update to the offline experience.",2022-07-30 09:54:31,1
"This is about the app, NOT the content of Disney plus. .. The good: Layout and item descriptions are great. The different sections are easy to scroll through. .. The bad: Search. You can not reliably search for an actor/actress unless they happen to be the main character of the series/movie. .. The even Worse: If an actors name is listed in the details, you ought to be able to simply click the name and get a list of all movies/series for that actor. No such feature. .. Quality of app < content.",2021-02-28 09:48:33,2
"There is not enough original content to justify more than 1-2 months of subscription. If you're looking for nostalgic movies and TV series, this is the subscription for you. Aside from content, the interface leaves much to be desired. Unlike Amazon Prime or Netflix, the user must manually click ""Play next episode"". There is no option to skip recaps or skip intro so the user must fast forward through these parts. The app often does not load on my Smart TV without a restart.",2020-08-10 13:38:35,3

Terrible with downloads. Takes ages to download a film then once you're on a plane to watch a film it reports an error because you're not online. Of course I'm not because I'm on a plane. Total rubbish.,2024-01-22 08:40:03,1
"Great content, not bad app, but some pretty basic things are missing. Going back to watch a series, the app doesn't give you an indication of where you left off. That's pretty basic and should be able to do it. While watching a show on Chromecast, you can't view the current show's episode list. The notification bar on Android doesn't give you the option to rewind, fast forward, or go to the next or previous episode.",2019-11-12 21:57:36,3

"App works bad with chrome cast and android TV. Android TV connects to Bluetooth and content stops playing, the app can't play anything anymore untill Bluetooth sound disconnects. On phone it's 70% of all time only sound and no image, only black screen. Reset app, delete cache and alike doesn't change a thing. Really bad craftsmanship, multiple devices all have problems.

"$67 billion of annual revenue and they manage to produce the buggiest piece of garbage app ever. The catalogue is fine. But the app in itself a horrendous. Hour long loading screens, video buffering like there's no tomorrow. No buffering on Netflix and Prime video, none whatsoever, but on Disney+ it happens every minute. Just great. Try to download more than 3 videos at the same time and the queued videos won't download themselves, try playing downloaded videos and you get freezes.",2022-11-26 10:01:00,1

"Works ok, expected better from a company as big as Disney. Missing some fairly key features that will hopefully be added: -Needs the ability to resume watching where you left off. Pretty essential really. -Also needs the ability to adjust streaming quality on Wifi for those of us with slower connections/data limitations. You can do it for mobile data, but not Wifi. Seems silly you can't do both and adding this will go a fair way to alleviating the buffering issues people have been experiencing",2019-11-19 07:23:40,3

"Great content provided the app actually starts up... Which it frequently doesn't. It just cannot get through the Google auto sign-in. Have to delete all app data and relaunch. Slower and less intuitive navigation compared to other OTT, no voice search, frequent ""something went wrong"" messages, cannot cast to Fire stick (though Chromecast works okay), searching for individual episodes of TV series not possible (eg ""Mickey's big band concert"").",2021-06-25 13:35:41,1

"Honestly this app sucks. The content is great, but trying to use this app is a nightmare. It always buffers whilst im watching something and because the app is so slow it takes ages to find what im looking for and its just a total mess. And its not only terribly optimised on phone, but on tv too. Disney really needs to do something about this app because its just plain awful and slow and annoying. They should use netflix as a model.",2022-11-14 21:21:55,1

"I love all the shows / content. However, and sometimes is his life I get interrupted and have to pause or stop my show a half way through. The only thing I don't like about this app is that it does not restart the last show that I watched from where I stopped it. Nor does it have a spot for currently watching or watched content. So that means I always have to search for the show I was watching.",2019-11-17 21:45:23,3
Downloaded movies won't play when streaming only sound works sometimes or takes hours to load and then buffers for several minutes.

Most the time when I'm watching movies too it will tell me I'm unable to play the movie especially nearing the end.

TV app makes me sign in with email and password and then a pin number as well. I only signed up again to watch a couple of new series but this app is so annoying having to enter all my details whenever I open it.

Until now no major issues. Feels smooth. No crashes. Fast loads. Nice overview of shows and movies. Easy to find stuff I'm looking for. One thing that would be great is to have the app remember devices. Logging in everytime after I closed it is a little frustrating. Maybe separate logins for the accounts would also be really nice.,2020-03-24 18:32:15,5
"Good show variety and has all episodes which is a bonus for anyone who like to binge watch. However I have discovered that recently; the app on the phone tends to only provide audio, and not show a visual picture when watching certain shows (haven't watched every show, obviously so can't vouche for them). If this is fixable that would be really appreciated as I like to watch it on the phone at night, instead of the tv or laptop top. I would rate Disney+ ☆☆☆☆ But the Disney+app ☆☆☆",2020-02-01 05:20:21,3
"The app on both my phone and PS4 will freeze while the audio keeps playing. I understand that this is a new product and there will be issues.

"The content is great but the app isn't. My device is an Android TV and it worked fine for few days but now it doesn't play any audio. I restarted the device and reinstalled the app but still. Aside from that recent issue i liked the way Disney grouped its content, it makes it easy for the user to navigate the app finding relevant content, for example the 90's X-Men cartoon can be found at the ""Marvel Legacy Animation"" at the Marvel front page and also in the ""X-Men collection"" at the search tab. The one thing that bugs me is that you can't remove a show from the ""continue watching"" row, so in the long run is gonna get really cluttered.",2021-01-03 05:49:58,3
"Unsubscribing until this app is fixed and more content is up. For the amount of movies Disney owns there is a serious lack of content.. I'm more disappointed with the app itself, with a boot up time of two minutes before you can even start selecting something and then some tiles don't load up, you can't multitask with the app and there's limited control. Might come back in 6 months when app is updated and content is abundant.",2019-11-24 10:17:49,2
"App regularly freezes up lately. Most importantly unable to remove options from now watching on Android which other apps are able to do. Frustrating that we can't get to remove the things we don't want to watch, but was just checking to see if we were interested.",2024-03-29 07:52:22,2
"Decent selection but less than stellar connection. I love the choice of films and shows on here and the original content is great to see. Would be nice if the app and site were stable enough to let me enjoy them! I have had so many problems it's infuriating, it takes ages to load then just doesn't, closing the notification brings you back to the homepage which is annoying since you have to click through all the menus to get to what you wanted to watch to try again. It's awful, please fix this",2021-07-13 18:13:07,2
"I've cancelled my subscription due to Disney's support for the genocide being committed by Israel against the people of Palestine. On a side note, this app is poor, as you cannot delete partially watched shows from your list. Let's face it, some of what's on here is not great, if you accidentally watch part of something then realise it's not gor you, it remains in your continue watching list, there's no delete.",2024-01-20 08:55:07,1
Please fix the app. I have reported countless times to the support that on a weekly basis the app fails to connect to disney plus. The only solution that I was given was to uninstall the app and then reinstall. Afterwards all the downloaded programmes and then deleted! Great! Very poor. (08/04/22) Still having issues with the app. Every couple of days the app will fail to open. I then have to reinstall the app to get access the service I'm paying for! In doing so all my downloads are lost!,2022-04-08 12:08:32,1
"I wish the episodes would play automatically. That went you leave the app it still plays in the backgroung. For the amount paid I shouldn't have to pay an extra $30 for new release. The volume is so low and the screen is so touchy, if you even graze the bottom of the screen it skips. The app buffers a lot if you try skip ahead or back. You should be able to message while watching movies with others rather than just share emoji. This app it tolerated cause it Disney!!!would not recommend!!!",2022-01-07 08:21:34,1
"Netflix has been around for several years now, and instead of making an app that is easy to use with the quality of life features netflix offers, you deliver us this piece of garbage. Its buggy, many of the times you cannt delete your downloads, your download speed is a disaster, you dont get the option to skip intros, you dont get the option to see the episodes of the show you are watching. If this wasnt for marvel shows and star wars i would have uninstalled it yesterday! Fix this asap!!!",2022-06-23 18:15:33,1

"Great selection of shows but using the app is HELL, compared to other streaming services. 1. Errors happen way too often 2. It takes forever to download shows 3. Downloaded shows sometimes don't play offline 4. The algorithm is terrible. Suggested shows are irrelevant to what I've been watching. You'd think that when you click 'Suggested' on Finding Dory, you'd find Finding Nemo but nope. 5. The search function is... just broken. Please fix these. Otherwise, might have to reconsider this app.",2021-07-18 06:37:16,2
Shows are slow to load. Auto start is on yet the next show in que doesnt play OR IF it does it skips right to the end EVERY time so I have to drag the play to the beginning to watch it. Seems there are still lots of glitches. I've never had issues chromecasting with netflix or prime yet disney doesnt seem to link well. Hopefully they get worked out soon.,2020-01-05 02:12:24,2
There's a lot of room improvement. Please fix some of the bugs listed below 1. I do not understand why SDR setting prevent a TV showing 4K. If the TV or the Chromecast device is set to fix on SDR it only showcase in 1080 which is a bummer 2. Why is there is occasion but that when a Bluetooth speaker is connect to the Chromecast content cannot be play. It is just ridiculous 3. The UI is slow and not effective to scroll around. 4. Sound is quite blend on default.,2022-05-08 14:03:49,1
"They definitely worked on the buffering issue. Way faster. I did read they bought Hulu and was cool to see that as a ""beta"" within the app. Works great. And marked a lot of shows inside. Props",2023-12-13 19:07:42,5
This app is not available on my Samsung smart TV. There is no cast option..you only get sound no picture if you use mirroring and when I use my laptop to watch..the movie/show freezes a lot. So the only option left it to watch it on the cell phone and thats not how I want to watch Marvel movies or movies like Avatar. As far as the content is concerned..it's okay.. majority of stuff we have already seen it. They need to improve a lot. Start by fixing your website..movies freezing is not good.,2019-12-28 01:01:38,3
"I've had Disney + for one day and already it's become unusable on my phone. Everytime I tap on an episode/movie to watch it freezes on an endless loading screen. It's also finicky when you pause and resume play the image is frozen while the sound plays. It escentially lags as its trying catch up to where you previously left off. So far not impressed and hoping for some changes/updates soon, and hopefully before the free trial ends because at this rate I don't want to be charged until improvement",2019-11-18 05:46:50,1
What is the point of letting me download videos to my device if they refuse to play unless the device has a perfect data connection? Constant error 39 on trying to play downloaded content. Used to be every so often. Now it is EVERY time I use the app. Bloody annoying as using when travelling was the main reason for subscribing....,2024-04-23 16:31:12,2
"Yep, been suckered in like most who are writing reviews on here. Connectivity issues all day long. All other subscriptions work on all of my other devices, so not a internet issue. Sad really, this app has some really good viewing on it, if it ever loads of course. Please pick your game up and fix the main issue, which is obvious from what the others writing here are saying. IT WON'T LOAD. I'm sure old Walt himself would be very disappointed in this attempt of an app. Thankyou....",2021-10-03 02:39:45,2

Constantly saying service unavailable, lagging, stuttering, buffering etc. This applies on both fire sticks in the house and mobile. Netflix and prime video never have these issues.

"Garbage app. We signed up for the latest promo for $2 a month for 3 months and it's complete trash. Glitches, doesn't load, doesn't save your spot in a movie or a series, closes right out in the middle of playing constantly.

Wish there was a continue watching section, it would also be amazing to be able to keep playing while using other functions on phone for those who dont have smart TVs. Ps3 compatibility is a stretch but would put the cherry on top.",2019-11-15 22:01:16,4

"Disappointing app compared to similar streaming options. Lots of issues with the ""download for later"" - videos for the toddler wouldn't work overseas. Glitchy, no ""play from beginning"" option if your kids favourite show or film is half way through you can only ""resume"" which isn't always what they want. Other casting glitches where it plays the thing you were last watching instead of the thing you just selected. Hopefully they figure out the glitches.",2020-01-25 05:01:12,2
Has to be one of the laggiest streaming services available. Been trying to watch a 2 hour movie the last 4 hours now and it's timed out 4 times. I click to continue watching after restarting the app and it restarts the movie from the beginning. I'm finally at the end/climax of the movie and boom it has an error again. Borderline unwatchable at times.,2022-05-25 02:20:44,1
"Disney plus is good because you can find all the good content that they have to offer, but there are lots of bugs like the app not recognizing you watched a chapter, the audio going before the image or it making you create a profile more than once because it disappeared at the first try. I think with a but of time this can be the best app of this kind",2021-01-17 15:19:34,3
Horrible interface. I m watching on PS4. Way rudimentary interface as compared to Netflix or even amazon prime. The video streaming is highly unstable. At times it fast forwards without me even touching the remote. 90% of times I get the error that something went wrong without even doing anything. My internet connection is quite stable and I don't face such issues with any other streaming service on same medium.,2020-09-09 12:05:28,1
"Very enjoyable app. I would suggest the ability to ""Mark as complete"" to films sitting within your continue watching section, as films do pile up if you are not a person who watches the credits. I also tend to have issues with full screen videos, when i choose to try and go home on my tablet (samsung tb s6) I have to swipe up at the bottom to get the tablets options, when doing this it tends to move the films place.",2020-05-04 10:13:56,4

"Maddening. On the SmartTV. Every time you perform an action, such as moving through the menu, it produces an unpleasant bell sound, which is exasperating, especially if you use the app at night. And they have no option in the menu to disable it. The menu only allows you to change the streaming quality. It is URGENT to enable the option to turn off those menu sounds. Really BAD user experience with the smartTV version of the app. I feel a headache every time I need use the menu.",2022-01-08 09:12:43,1

"Many titles that I personally love to have access to. Really glad this exists, but the app/website hold this service back. The design is a bit of a mess (things like the front page having 3-4 star wars slides with nearly the same shows & movies being listed), continue watching slide hardly ever keeps up, and the service tolerance for sub par wifi is attrocious. Services like Netflix, prime, or Hulu, all work fine with poor wifi while Disney+ buffers like crazy. Fix the back end please",2020-01-29 05:44:31,2
"I do love disney+. Having access to Disney's catalogue is a great idea. Have enjoyed it on a TV. However, on a tablet or phone (the purpose of this review), it's a different experience I'm afraid. It requires signal to play downloaded movies, which is flawed. Downloaded movies should work on airplane mode. I've tried Galaxy Tab A. Galaxy s10e. Rebooting, uninstalling. Nothing works. Couldn't find anything online that sorts the problem out.",2021-08-20 20:51:59,1

"So for those struggling with the update, I found clearing the cache of the app and restarting my phone did the trick. Couldn't even get the app to open, would just get stuck on the first load screen. Settings - apps - (find problematic app) - storage - clear cache. Had to do this with Google maps once or twice to get it to work properly. Hope this helps someone =D",2021-05-28 13:50:26,3
"Worst app I have ever used, doesn't matter on mobile, android tv or whatever, primitive, slow and unresponsive with non age appropriate material being displayed in kids profiles, Disney should invest more in developing an average app rather than expanding their business in arms or other markets..",2023-12-08 19:53:23,1
"The content has been pretty good. Three problems i have found, the first being that when i watch an episode from a series, it doesnt tell me that i have watched that specific episode in the list. No progression bar appears on each episode, so say for instance, you watch half an epsiode and later come back, how do you remeber what the episode is that you have partially watched. When you are watching multiple series, there is no way of tracking what epsiode you are up to.",2019-11-19 13:02:47,4
Content is great but my review is for the app. Menu's are slow and unresponsive. And while playing downloads its constantly buffering or very stop start with visual and sound. Where as I can stream of YouTube or watch downloads elsewhere with no issue so it isn't a reception problem. I have to close all of my apps to get it working again after leaving it. Amazon prime and netflix allow for background running and provide a mini screen while doing other things. Great service let down by app.,2020-04-23 07:08:45,2
"Only had this for the week so far. And I am enjoying it heaps. Just would like one thing to change though. The shows that are in the continue watching, it would be great to be able to delete them without having to go right through the show. Ok to do that on my phone for movies but for series you have to go right through every episode of every season. That is a pain there. But if you do fix this problem it needs to be done on Apple tv as well as android.",2020-01-30 05:51:41,5
Over all for a pretty new app it's not bad. The interface is a little rough but I suspect it will improve in a short while. I must say I was blow away by the quantity of fantastic movies available and highly recommend this to anyone who likes marvel Disney Pixar or any other company that disney owns. The reason I am however giving it only two stars is because I cannot log in. Every time I log in it just says to call customer services with no explanation why. I waited 30+ mins and no answer.,2019-11-24 02:53:30,2
"The app is currently is in too ridiculous of a state not to call out.

App overheats phone by using too much processing power, when both Netflix and YouTube doesn't. Get it together.",2021-04-09 19:21:36,1
"System has been crashing and video keeps loading non-stop on mobile phone despite stable connection on both mobile date and WiFi. Strangely works well on iPad, Apple TV & laptops.

Needs fixing, or else I'll be dumping the app, and probably the whole Disney subscription, as I've been watching movies at the gym via Netflix for 4 years so far, and NEVER had a problem!",2022-08-08 14:31:17,1
"There need to be more options/customization in the app for what titles appear on the explore/landing page - I would like the option to hide titles that I know for sure I'm not interested in watching. this would make browsing so much easier w less ""noise"".

This is the worst app I have ever used. It would not open after I installed it and so called customer service and they fixed it. Then it worked and I downloaded a program. It played and then would not play again. And so after trouble shooting was redirected to reodownload the app again because there was an issue with it!

Only streaming app I have with this issue, others have resolved similar Bluetooth issues. Disappointed!!",2023-07-18 15:14:58,1
"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love that I have my disney fix now through this app. The streaming service and app themselves though, are a mess. On even great internet connection, I experience awful lag, audio/visual glitches and random fast fowarding mid movie. I have no problems with any other services (netflix, amazon, crave, acorn) on the same devices. It's frustrating seeing as this is a paid service.",2020-05-13 12:04:52,2
"Not sure if I should post this here, but when I use Disney plus on my LG Oled tv the screen keeps getting stuck for a second and then goes on in an accelerated way to make up for the missing time. It's like it wants to buffer but then changes its mind. I don't have this with any other video apps. It probably has to do with Internet bandwidth but it seems that Disney takes up an unreasonable amount of bandwidth compared to other video services",2021-08-18 11:21:10,3
"- Severe software issues such as needing internet connection to open app & enter pin code, no playback speed adjustment options, no lock screen controls, etcetc + Better tv show selection than Netflix, also very smart to pick up popular drops from competition services. - Unfortunately the app also does not allow playback while other apps are displayed, nor does it allow for playback with screen off. Overall, this app is an acceptable start, and I hope that the designers listen :)",2022-06-05 20:08:49,2
"This is constantly crashing or not loading. Also when playing a film/show, it will glitch and freeze on there whether it be on the phone, sky box or tablet. My partner works as a telecoms engineer and has test our line multiple times. He says the glitches where it freezes then reconnects onto another scene, is an issue with Disney Plus server. Either way I'm sick of trying to get on this app on my phone or fire stick! Been trying for weeks now with no success",2021-03-05 22:54:52,1
"This is by far the worst streaming app out there. Constant buffering, loading, blue circle in the middle. App constantly stops responding. The amount of times I have uninstalled and reinstalled is ridiculous. Seeing other reviews on here I'm not alone.

Been like this for months, nothing helped. edit: Changing some kind of subtitle options from DEVICE settings hidden somewhere, I could fix this by changing the style/outline/shadow. But the styles/outline... etc didn't match what was said in the device settings. Also this is the first app ever to have a bug like this.",2023-05-24 14:01:31,4
"Great content however the app could use some updates/features such as 'continue watching' to remember where you are in a series/movie. Also the Chromecast feature is buggy, it never picks up from where you last watched, it always starts from the beginning. It also sometimes cuts out and you have to reboot the app. With some TLC this app could be a lot better.",2019-11-19 01:48:59,3
At the moment just downloaded the app. Can't use on my smart TV as it hasn't updated to Disney plus from Disney life. I'm in Ireland. Downloaded app to stream to TV. Can stream to TV with audio and no picture. I'll be cancelling. I've 3 children and was hoping to enjoy as a family all the movies to together to cut down screen time on their devices. 1 star from me. Will check back and see how it is if and when resolved.

The change to the start of chicken little has ruined it, I didnt even wanna watch the rest of the movie anymore 2. either it's my TV or you have changed the look on inside out to make it look more ""realistic"" but its ugly and it just doesn't suit the cartoony type movie it is. Other than that I havent found any problems with the app",2019-12-18 08:59:57,4
"I love the stuff provided but the app is horrendous, its slow, poorly optimised, when I tab out and come back to my film it goes from the start, takes 3 years to load simple things and when it does nothing shows up on the screen, the experience while in the film is a little jank but you won't be using that anyway, the lack of small screen is annoying, I like the content, hate the app.",2021-02-04 17:40:04,2
"Absolutely broken app. The opposite of 'user-friendly'. I would have understood if it was some small company but not an absolute behemoth that is Disney, which clearly has means to design something that works.

"Great content, awful app! For example, recently I downloaded a series to watch while on holiday, some of the episode didn't download at all, would press the download button several times before it does anything. When going to watch it, the app doesn't let you sign in without Internet, occasionally it does let you in and take you to your downloads, but most of the time it will just say incorrect pin and the when I try to play an episode I'll get a black screen for 15 minutes before it plays.",2021-08-25 19:04:47,1

Not even worth a free trial.",2019-11-17 17:58:59,1
"I have multiple streaming platforms and truly love the shows and movies on Disney Plus. However the application itself is one of worst compared to the rest I own. It's always lagging buffering and crashing on both my phone and tablet. All of my devices are Android based so maybe it works better on other operating systems, I don't know. I really hope they fix they application because I don't want to cancel my subscription but I am getting that frustrated with it.",2022-02-25 03:19:32,2
No issues but just a suggestion for improvement...it would be nice if we could create playlists so movies could be watched in succession like a tv show. I have a few movies I like to watch over and over again but when one finishes I gotta stop and look for another. Would make it easier if I could add them to a list and they would just play through on their own.,2022-12-17 16:14:23,4

If you're going to make a streaming service, make sure it works first, I've seen loads of similar issues from other people and it just proves that Disney made the UI in a rush to compete with Amazon Prime Video and Netflix",2022-08-18 23:22:35,1
"Lots of content to watch, but the app itself is probably the worst of all streaming services on both mobile AND pc.. it never continues a video where you left off (both pc / mobile), you can't adjust the volume (mobile) and it constantly crashes (pc). Considering the amount of money disney is investing into movies and shows, you'd think they'd make the app better",2022-09-09 14:49:44,1
It stopped working after the last update. I have several shows dowloaded and it says error 39 and that there's a problem with my connection. How come it says that when the video it's dowloaded already... And my connection is just fine cuz in the meantime I'm using another streaming platform and it works smoothly so there must be a problem with this app.,2022-09-15 00:39:34,2
"Pretty good. Good shows and movies but on mobile when you press next episode it takes a couple of seconds to actually play the episode, sometimes it doesn't sync where I am on an episode properly and the download option needs you to log in to watch, which isn't an issue to me since I have data and can log in quickly and turn off my data, but for others that don't have data, it would be an issue. Overall, I think it's a pretty good streaming service. And it's cheaper than Netflix.",2021-02-27 04:08:50,4

"This app has been one of the best functioning streaming apps I have (I have 5 and some are an absolute nightmare). Unfortunately, this latest update has completely ruined some pretty important aspects, the main one being the sound intermittently distorting throughout episodes.

Pls fix it :(",2023-09-21 04:40:56,1

Soundtrack and voice over parts were coming through just fine, but speech and SFX? Barely audible! Highly disappointing as I my freesat box doesn't get this and I don't want to have to shell out more money for an Amazon firestick. If Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and BBC iPlayer can get this widely used function right, why can't Disney? Come on guys, get it together!",2020-03-29 17:24:13,2
"It keeps randomly shutting off when I watch on my TV and on my phone it is constantly buffering, if it even loads at all. Just the worst.

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but this made it worse.",2022-07-03 00:10:28,1

Don't like either that when changing the audio language most of the times it get stock and have to restart several times, nor that I don't have the Spanish audio language in some of Europe's countries.",2023-03-30 12:13:54,3
"Update. The app has improved and alot more stable, however I feel it's missing a very important feature which shows users the progress or completion of shows or movies. I really wanted to like this, but nothing but issues right out of the gate. I guess it's new but very buggy. Unable to watch a single thing. Bad first impression.",2020-09-03 13:40:04,3
Downloads don't play unless you're connected to the internet... which defeats the purpose of downloading content....,2024-03-06 11:52:13,3
"Nice selection of content and pleasing presentation, but that's about everything good there is to say. You guys should take a close look at Netflix. That's how you do streaming the right way. Easy UI, reliable and good performance, skippable intros, no jumping to credits when resuming episodes, very few bugs etc. In short: the user experience is horrible when you consider what other services offer at that price point. I am considering letting go of Disney+ because of the constant annoyances.",2021-03-11 10:07:41,2
"Love the content, the app is garbage. Long load time. I'm just used to the nice little things Netflix does. If I download several episodes of a series over wifi and watch it later on data I have to go back and select the next episode from downloads or it streams it. Just a minor irritant until I get the data overage charge. Also I often get Spanish versions of video. Vocals are in English and I can select English subtitles but the text within the movies ie. Star Wars opening is in Spanish.",2020-01-27 06:19:31,2
"This app is super slow and barely functions. My internet is fine, as are all other apps on this device and Disney+ works fine on my firestick. Its just this app that seems to have a problem. It often cant even load the menu. If I uninstall and reinstall it works well for a short time, if I'm lucky a few days, but it is just ridiculous to keep doing that.",2022-04-03 02:23:41,1
Not all that impressed. The stars I have given are for the epic content. The ones that are blank are because the app itself needs a lot of work. Very glitch in that it cuts out quite often and sometimes so badly that it starts the movie over completely. Thus adding the fact that these movies or series won't continue where you've left off.,2019-11-19 19:24:44,2
Its surprising some of the basic features this app is missing. A continue watching section would be nice so you don't have to remember what season/episode you were on. It also doesnt allow my phone to go to sleep if I do while watching a show. My screen is lit up the whole night if I fall asleep. Content is great but the app needs a few tweaks.,2019-11-14 14:29:22,3
"Not happy at all. For some reason everytime I open the app it just sits there buffering. Eventually the home page loads, I press continue watching and all I get is a black screen. I have been onto the Disney plus help page and have done all the recommended steps even uninstalling but still nothing. The only thing I changed recently is where my downloads are stored but have changed that back. All other streaming apps are working perfectly. Disappointed 😞",2023-09-28 18:00:46,1
"The has has all but stopped working with my Chrome cast. It is a coin flip any time I try to watch anything wether or not it will actually play or will just freeze up and become unresponsive. The app also frequently fails to register if you've watched an episode or, if it does register, will only register that you've watched an arbitrary amount but not the full thing. One of the richest companies in the world and they cannot manage basic streaming app functionality.",2023-09-12 11:17:42,1
"It's good, there are new movies and series but the app needs more reworking made on it. You have to wait until the episode end at the credits for the next episode which is frustrating it doesn't go to next episode 😫 and on Galaxy Z Fold 2 when unfolded there has to be more screen options It's either too small or too big and bits gets cropped, please sort that out. I would like to use my phones display efficiently.",2021-02-23 12:30:39,3
"Great content, terrible app. Buggy, issues loading, pauses randomly and worst of all, doesn't work without a network connected. Whats the point of downloading movies for the kids if you cant load the app when in flightmode. Tried multiple different devices and restarts and have had the same result. All this needs to be sorted before being good!",2021-06-27 06:37:35,1
"So I do enjoy this app but there are a few things that need to be fixed, so its not perfect nor is it the best it can be changes do need to be made, there is nothing that tracks what you watch so if your watching a show you have to remeber what episode you were on, it has trouble loading sometimes because it wants to be best quaility but it will stop working in the same spots and you have to let it sit",2019-11-17 21:57:07,3
"It has a very good selection of movies and TV shows and has a good price but the app is pretty buggy right now and it's almost unusable, most of the time when I click on a movie or show it will not load it and I have to exit and click again but even when I do that when I want to click on a different season of the show then that won't load. Once they fix the bugs and polish the app a little bit, I can see this app being one of the better streaming services.",2019-11-12 13:16:04,2
"This app is a disappointment. After getting all the subscription stuff out of the way, it stops working. We couldn't get it to play any film. The app just hangs there with a black screen. In addition, the back button doesn't work. We have to close the entire application to be able to access it again. At first we thought it was our device so we stopped all the other apps as well as applied any missing updates. Nothing changed. We don't have this issue with Hulu or Netflix. They just work.",2019-12-02 12:52:17,1
"I go to sign in, but it doesn't connect. It works fine last night. Total BS.",2024-02-16 03:08:29,1
"Pretty bad app honestly. Lots of content, and I'd lie if I said that access to so many great films and series was bad, but the app is constantly breaking. I've had to redownload the app due to it not wanting to load, claiming there was an issue connecting, or a series I was in the middle of watching disappearing despite still existing online (redownloading the app fixed these, albeit temporarily). If any of this bothers you, maybe wait til it's fixed- it's a huge pain. I've redownloaded 13 times",2021-10-28 07:23:57,1
Since I start watching it my TV freezing all the time. Thank for this troubles.,2024-02-28 13:02:28,1
"Keeps switching languages all on its own even after choosing preferred language. It also turns subtitles on randomly and will keep putting them on episode after episode even after turning them off. There's no skip intro prompt in the app. You can only have 100 things in your watch later list at a time. All in all a frustrating experience and my least preferred streaming service, even compared to Prime(which is complete bullocks).",2023-01-17 02:52:04,1
For the past 4 days my console xbox and ps4 signed me out of my disney account. So when I tried to go to the website all I get is a blue screen and buffering spinning swirl thing. I fought so hard through this week dealing with my horrifying job and bs at the house. I just knew that one thing could help me put me in a decent mood was disney plus show Loki. It's a good show and because of this bullsh..... I can't watch my show. I want my subscription extended!!!!! One star from me!!!,2023-11-05 00:48:37,1
"Things that they say are available in Asia, are not actually available in Asia. It's very frustrating.",2024-03-08 13:53:19,2
"Content: great. Navigation: decent. Streaming: dog turd. Okay, so out of all the streaming services, this is the worst as you'll get the buffer wheel almost as often as the episode has minutes. Even using the app on a device in the same room as the router makes no difference. Or even downloading the episode to then stream. Prepare to ""enjoy"" your shows with the most significant scenes having 5 buffer wheels in just as many words Makes me wonder if Disney are actually trying to fail at streaming.",2022-11-15 14:32:31,3
"The same message keeps popping up when I open the app ""there seems to be an issue connecting to the Disney+ service"". Its now going onto day 4!! Tried restarting my phone, uninstalling and installing still nothing. When it works, it works fine but when it doesn't, it could go on for days! Definitely not a happy paying customer!",2021-09-20 04:41:59,1
"Last few weeks my phone (S10+) has been lagging significantly. I couldn't figure out what it was and had to restart my phone constantly. After reading some posts on reddit, someone suggested I delete Disney + And unbelievably it worked. How shocking is it that a multi-trillion dollar company releases an app that actually RUINS your phones performance even when the app is closed. This above was enough to put me off Disney +",2020-01-19 22:19:04,1
"The series doesn't save where I left off when I turn off the app... It's always 2 or 3 episodes behind on what I've already seen... Not a big issue, but a bit annoying... Also not clearing shows and movies that I have finished watching... One would think that a simple thing like that should be sorted this far into the release... 🤷🏻‍♂️ Then the later release dates in my region (Korea) is also annoying...",2022-01-06 14:04:52,3
"Generally not a bad app...BUT since the last upgrade it no longer works with miracast. Even though my phone connects fine and the sound plays on my TV when connected, for some reason the Disney+ app no longer projects the video onto the TV screen. So it plays sound from the TV but only shows a black screen...even though the phone is connected via miracast and the video is playing on the phone screen. No idea why it's suddenly not mirroring across. Wasn't an issue prior to the last upgrade.",2022-05-12 00:46:45,2
"Cancelling my subscription. Disney+ has basically Star Wars and superhero movies for adults, rest is for kids. Chromecast support is absolutely HORRIBLE, it takes an hour to watch an episode of Mandalorian due to casting cutting off and Disney+ resetting to the beginning. Netflix worked better in 2014, fix the service! Can't even use my phone for casting, since Disney+ only supports Samsungs or still doesn't work on Android 12. Any other app I'm using casts fine, which points to Disney+. They obviously rely on the big titles keeping people using this poorly functional service. Chromecast issues could be forgiven, but it doesn't work properly even on a desktop computer. That's just unacceptable in 2021, for a company this big. Usability aspects are years behind Netflix, for example.",2021-01-11 09:11:26,1
Use the app all the time great selection of content but unfortunately after a recent update haven't been able to access app under error code 83 despite Google play having my device listed as compatible. Hope this gets fixed soon EDIT: Have changed my review from 3 stars to one star as its now been two weeks and there has been zero communication and issue has still not been resolved despite a lot of people seemingly having the same issue.,2022-09-20 09:35:14,1
"Great selection of shows and movies, however the app has a download feature allowing you to watch offline and yet it still asks you to log in which needs either data or WiFi to watch. I will be giving this 5 stars once all the bugs are fixed because there's some good content I've been okay with it until today where I had to uninstall the app to troubleshoot and now find that I've lost all of my downloaded films. I use the service for my workshifts as it helps to entertain the 14 hour days.",2021-03-01 15:35:54,3
Major playback issue* The video will load as if it is to buffer but then wil skip a very large section of the given movie of show you are watching. I noticed this on 5 out of 5 movies I watched last night agian. One of the movies I got half way through and it buffered and skipped to the end. I had to completely back out of the page and load it again.,2020-04-09 02:40:50,3
Great app but has big fluals like insane amounts of ads for basic plan if that's fix it's a big bang for your buck,2024-03-09 15:42:51,3
"While, the app is very nice and selection quite good (shoutout to The Mandalorian), there are still a few key things that are missing : - a ""continue watching"" tab or section with all your movies/show you started and indications you've watched an episode - a better search engine - more shows and movies, even though I understand that there are still titles that are under contract with other streaming services - the ability to binge watch original shows when they come out, not one per week.",2019-11-19 22:55:50,3
"I ended my subscription due to the lousy new shows. Not to mention the political messaging that they keep shoving down our throats. We get it, you're woke. Now make some good content that stays true to the genre. When you bought LucasFilm, I genuinely had hope. But after The Last Jedi, and the character assassination of Luke Skywalker, I knew you had no intention in keeping Lucas' vision. You focus only on women as flawless heroes while making men irrelevant and hapless. I hope you crash.",2024-04-18 07:41:11,1
"Platform itself is decent, but for the past week the mobile app became very laggy and unresponsive. Starting a show would take almost a minute. There were no spinning circles to indicate buffering or any app activity. Pressing start next episode effectively wouldn't work as by the time it did, the credits had already finished. Resorted to clearing cache for the app to be fluid again, but it'd lag again after a few eps.",2021-04-10 04:58:01,2
"This app is useless. If I want to watch something on Disney+ on my phone, I'm generally not going to be at home on WiFi.

It's fine for a while and then gets incredibly choppy and borderline unwatchable. I'd like to be able to use the app on a device that isn't my PC. Otherwise, Disney+ is a fine app and I enjoy having all Disney movies accessible from one place.",2022-04-25 18:11:37,3

"I was pretty exited for this app, but sadly it's a huge dissapointment. That's due to more than one reason really. First of all you can twatch downloaded content offline without having opened the app online. Second it locks you out a ton. Also I tend to have connectivity issues which can only be solved through deinstalling and reinstalling the app. Sadly that also deletes the downloaded videos and since my room doesn't really have an internet connection I can't watch it without having to move.",2021-10-02 07:16:38,2

"I'm really happy with all the content on this app. There are a few problems that I hope they will fix though. To start the continue watching section is the same for all the profiles, instead of each person having a separate preference list and continue watching. The video also takes about 30 seconds to catch up when you leave and come back to something, and sometimes won't load properly. Other than that it pretty good.",2019-11-28 12:43:06,4

This would happen at least twice a day. I thought it was another app, so I deleted it to no avail. I figured it was just my phone getting old so I was like oh well. Eventually I noticed it would freeze and shut down my phone multiple times while watching shows or movies, realizing that this app is the problem. This needs to be fixed.",2021-05-27 06:13:17,1

And the fact that when you want to download something it takes forever, but I have only used the WiFi. So might be different when using the network.

"Very bad experience, I don't know if you need a very good internet but, to say that Netflix works very well for me, I am answering that this application is terrible. A movie took 1 week to download and even so it was not downloaded, I am not to leave opinions or claims but for the value of $ 6500clp. This app is not worth it. There are better ones. All I can say is that I hope they fix the issue. It is not very funny to pay 6500 clp and not be able to use the application. APPALLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2021-08-01 14:33:08,1

Unstable really. Keeps loading forever and complains about the internet connection even though I'm only trying to watch downloaded content. Basically everything is laggy. There's no problem with the internet connection in any other apps. Also keeps crashing after loading forever. Really disappointed as I just paid for the service 🤦‍♀️ It also has some work to do in for example sorting and organising watchlist and navigating to shows from the downloaded view (to download more etc).,2023-07-06 11:38:44,1

However, in the past 3 hours since the service has launched, I have received the ""unable to connect to Disney+"" message twice already. Had trouble playing a particular show as well.

The only other thing I don't like is when your casting and a movie is almost done and you want to restart it there is no restart button. Just a continue and only when casting.",2022-11-08 21:17:10,3

While it includes a download feature, the way Disney seems to do subscription checks means that without a solid Internet connection it won't work reliably. If you want something you can hand the kids with downloaded content to watch in the car, the Disney app is not it.

Theres no indication on what episodes you have watched already. They seem to shove the same options in your face over and over making it hard to find the stuff you actually want to watch.

It's unfortunate that even with a huge monopoly and a billion doller business Disney was unable to make an application that held up to competitors. I think the only mobile streaming app worse than disney plus is Amazon's. Frequent sound sync issues poor frame rates and frequent buffering are consistent issues that I've never experienced using competitor products. Not worth the subscription in it's current state I can assure you.,2019-11-27 06:31:44,1

Had numerous issues with programs/movies that I download at home for when I'm out and about (I travel by train a lot for work) and it's super frustrating when you go to the effort of being organised just for them to fail. Disney help just advises you to re download the content which is useless when you are away from an internet connection. Also for all they're hype about their catalogue size, this is also lacking.",2020-04-29 15:24:58,1
"Love the app! Love Disney and it's content. If you are a Star Wars fan then it's a must have for the movies as well as the Mandalorian. Plenty of stuff for the kids as well. New content being added. It comes with a 1 week free trial so you can see if it's right for you.The app itself needs a bit of improving, I use it with a Chromecast, however frequently have issues with subtitles and closed captions as the options are there when you start the movie but disappear later on! 4 stars til fixed.",2019-12-03 05:33:15,4
"Bought a subscription about a month ago and for the entirety of the time using the app, how many episodes have I seen? 0. All that happens when you open the app is a plain Disney plus loading screen. I can't even browse the app because I'm stuck at the first loading screen. And their service is just as a terrible as their app is, way too many request to have it fixed with no reply of a solution. Instead I'm met with wanting to pay for my subscription for the following month. Disney, do better",2022-10-21 21:36:49,1

I'm not offline and I don't have any problems like this with amazon, Netflix etc. So please sort it out or I'm unsubscribing. I've called and got nowhere. Please sort this app out. You charge enough for it. And I can see that this is happening to nearly everyone with it. But unlike other apps and subscriptions , I havent seen them reply to 1 comment, and neither try and sort the problem out.",2023-01-04 15:52:02,1
wish it would be less woke. otherwise great app and good shows.,2024-03-03 04:49:26,5
App is buggy. The content is fantastic and the ui is easy to use but I have a problem every now and then with episodes being skipped while watching a series. A handful of times now I will resume watching a series and get 20 mins into an episode only to realise I've missed something in the story and then when I back out and check the episode descriptions I find that the app has inexplicably decided to move my resume point up for absolutely no reason. It's very frustrating and not spoiler friendly,2022-12-12 10:53:08,3
"Love Disney, love their creations, but they seriously need to make the app better to match Netflix. Downloaded videos take forever to get loaded. I need to wait about 1 minute to get one video played. When I exit out of the app and then come back, I need to wait another 1 minute to get the video resumed. What's the point of downloading the videos? Also play next video button always works tacky. It always have a few second delay.",2022-02-09 23:55:22,1
"I would have given more. But seen as I continually can't get into the app, on any of my devices. Is so frustrating. We have both disney and Netflix. We take turns to pick a movie (even kids) and its so annoying when we get our heart set on picking a disney one for the night and we can't even open the app. I don't know why I'm still paying for a service I can't use. I've had this app for over a year now! Not impressed with this app the last few weeks!!!",2022-05-06 06:48:10,1
"I do like the app because it has a lot of movies I enjoy and even past movie I haven't watched in years. The negatives would be it doesn't always keep the point saved when you turn it off. Also I don't know if this happens to anyone else, but when I connect my phone to our home internet the Disney app will not load. It only works with Mobile data. Other wise it will load if I watch it on my TV. If these small things were fixed it would easily be 5 stars.",2021-03-01 06:47:22,3
"It keeps crashing and having diff kinda errors. 23 41 etc. When it works, you can count on it to keep working.

Well I do LOVE all the movies on offer here so many the kids and I want to watch but we all get so excited to watch a movie only for it to not cast to the tv or just load forever then disconnect, I'm feeling like I am wasting my money on a monthly subscription when it would be easier and less disappointment to buy the movies on YouTube and cast that to the tv. So far other movie apps have been far less problematic but this one seems to be nothing but full of problems.",2020-04-29 04:47:12,2
"This app would be fine if it worked. The movies and shows are great, aswell as star, but there is one tiny problem. I can't login on my console. They dont allow you to just put in the email and password, they make you go to a website and put in a code. This would be fine if the site would actually load instead of taking me the the app on my phone. Everytime the app updates it kicks me out and I have to struggle for hours to use this damn app and I end up just using netflix which is way better",2021-03-06 00:21:53,1
"The phone streaming app is not good when compared to Netflix. I have constant connectivity issues which is really frustrating because it means you can't even access Disney+ to watch anything. Very slow to process and load. When an episode finishes you can't skip to next episode, have to fast forward and wait for long load time. App is poorly designed and is very hit and miss as to if it will actually work for you or not. Please update the interface and app itself other no point in subscription",2022-04-22 20:29:27,2
Massive issues with Chromecast compatibility. I have watched half a film and then gone back to resume and an 'unknown error' code appears. Ridiculous.

Our payment was unsuccessful as we didn't have enough money in our account. Fair enough. I put $$ on our debit card and updated account details. Continued getting error message from Disney+ even after updating details correctly a few times. Every other service I've ever used has allowed payment to go through after I've put $$ in my account & updated payment info. Disney is a multi-million $$ corporation that can easily afford to adjust their system to enable this easily. Not impressed.,2021-12-26 03:11:14,1
"Wish the new exclusive releases were a bit cheaper. Otherwise great catalogue that keeps growing and has something for everyone. On the app side, regularly asks me to log back in although I haven't logged out and haven't used on another device... a bit annoying but the fact that I can log onto my TV from unlocking the app on my smartphone kind of makes up for it.",2021-05-28 09:42:51,4

Saving language and subtitle settings? That's possible? Yes, it is! Every other streaming service has these features except disney+. But hey, they raised monthly costs and want more than 20 bucks for a new movie while netflix and Co. let you watch them without any additional costs. That's great, right?",2021-03-08 21:33:12,1
Really poorly designed/optimized. If I'm trying to pick up where I left of it will almost always be black screen and not play. Downloads don't play 90% of the time. App crashes when trying to delete a download or when trying to access settings. Downloads stuck at random % and never finish. App will stop downloading if left to run in the background so the app must be open and screen on to download. Lots of little details are implemented poorly. Expected better from a company as large as Disney,2020-03-05 00:56:26,1

"Unfortunately, the worst interface for switching between shows or tracking. what show you're watching! As of Nov 1, 23 they are changing their service agreement around password ""sharing""/travel, cost, & ads. No one at Disney online or the call center (inc a supervisor) was able to provide any info on the new cost, how many ads, or how subscriptions will be monitored if you're traveling. Beware as the lack of info is shady & deliberate. You have no idea what you are agreeing to.",2023-10-01 18:49:41,1
"The content is great. The app is subpar. My biggest complaint is probably no continue watching feature, so if you are going back to a show you have to try and remember the episode title that you watched last. Also been have some issues watching it over crome cast, it has taken me 5 minutes to pause the movie I was watching because the app on my phone was stuck loading and then didnt show that it was playing anything..",2019-11-22 11:31:43,2
Figured I would used play store credits for subscription. When setting up my account it was mandatory to add a credit card to the app... was double billed.

That's about the most positive thing I can say over the experience.,2020-05-27 00:19:59,1

Starts movies or episodes over sometimes you want to stream them and makes a lot of problems in combination with Chromecast. Offline videos only work properly when you got fast or no internet when the internet is slow it tries to connect to the server for some reason which takes a long time The progress in a movie sometimes just disappears too.

The only reason for two stars is it has a ton of content, which is perfect for staying inside this winter.",2022-01-16 22:26:52,2
Plays up the most out of all the streaming apps I use. I like Disney tv I just really wish the app was smoother. It glitches if I try to rewind or ho forward. If I stop a movie then return it goes back 10 minutes hence the rewind/fast-forward problem. The app some days struggles to connect to my crome cast. I have 5 streaming services we use regularly. Unfortunately Disney+ has the most problems. Currently the app keeps just shutting down on me. I just want it to run better please.,2023-07-04 22:11:22,3

Most awful app I've ever used in my life. I use this app on my fire TV stick and don't get me wrong the programs on it are great but what let's it down massively is the amount of bugs in it. It constantly restarts when trying to turn it on. When I attempt to rewind programs it is too slow and often puts the program back to the beginning or gets stuck entirely and exits the app. I have no problems with any other app on my fire TV stick just this one. I will be cancelling my membership soon.,2023-09-26 18:24:43,1
It used to work fine but now every time I go to watch something it starts to freeze and then my screen goes black. I turn it on and off but it carries on doing it and if the picture does work it lasts for about 10 seconds and starts flashing,2023-11-12 20:46:11,5
"watching with chromecast still isnt working properly. it just keeps loading no matter what i do. any other streaming service doesn't do that so the problem isn't in my connection. i'm considering to cancel my subscription, if this isn't fixed quickly since i've had this issue for months already and other people have been complaining and giving bad reviews because of it too.",2022-12-04 13:18:15,1
Loads to choose from. As a Dutch person I have been trying out the app and contents. I Chromecast from tablet to an older Samsung TV. It works great. Content wise I am still missing seasons from certain series. Hopefully they come soon. One of the things that annoy me when watching a series is that the app does not start the next episode like Netflix does,2019-11-07 18:38:15,4
"This app does not work on many Samsung TVs. It's unpredictable. Google searches confirm this. The problem has persisted ever since Disney+ launched, and Disney does not seem to have any intent on fixing this problem. On the flip side, if you don't want to watch Frozen a million times, buy a Samsung TV so that you can prove to your kids that Frozen is unavailable because the app doesn't work.",2020-09-25 23:08:19,1
"Everything that is played for the first time runs ok untill you pause it and resume later or rewind some time, then it keeps buffering forever. This bug occurs with many people and the forums are full of it and the suggestions are always the same dummy ones (perform a power cycle, reinstall app, update Chromecast, check internet connection) and nothing works. It's most likely related to playback state saving/restoring, as mentioned above. That's very annoying.",2022-01-17 23:12:16,1
The app has so many bugs it's ridiculous. 1)If you watch a series make sure you remember exactly where you're up to cause even though it says you can continue from where you stopped it just starts back at episode 1. 2) Autoplay just turns it self of every few weeks. 3) every now and again you won't be able to log into the app and you'll have to delete and reinstall. And the list goes on. Best way I can put it is this app is an absolute dumpster fire.,2021-12-27 10:11:07,1
"Underwhelming. With a dashboard ripped off from Netflix and a catalogue of old movies (or live action remakes of old movies), this is a weak attempt by Disney at throwing its weight around. They will have to add more of their vast properties and put out some solid original material (The increasingly disappointing Mandalorian isn't going to cut it) if they want to maintain and increase their subscriber base.",2019-12-05 03:03:45,2
"Disappointing that there isn't a My Watchlist on main screen, nor is there a continue watching section for movies or shows you start but can't watch in one sitting for whatever reason.

Turn Wi-Fi off and the app works fine, but then I'm using heaps of data when I should be able to watch using my Wi-Fi.",2019-11-22 09:49:08,2
"Regular (chrome cast) streaming video buffering happens. Loving Disney plus, otherwise. Hopefully they make streaming quality better over time. App doesn't show subtitles or audio options.

But I love seeing movies from my childhood that I can share with my young boys.",2019-11-22 12:06:46,3
I am trying to download the app and it is not letting me do so. I have deleted nearly everything off my phone apart from 40 pictures. It still won't let me download and it is becoming frustrating that I can't download the app .

"A year later and this app is still basically broken. Unreliable downloads, lists that don't refresh.

Every other streaming service seems to be able to get the basics working reliably.....",2022-09-21 17:11:18,1
"Will not work with my Chromecast, will not allow me to login on my tablet. The only place I can use it is on my phone. I plan on cancelling in a few days once my free week is up. Disney focused so much on marketing all their movies/shows that it's unfortunate how difficult they make it to watch anything. I was really looking forward to it and hope the issues get fixed. I'll be watching for that.",2019-11-12 13:42:12,2
This is a cool app! I have found a few shows I haven't seen in awhile! There are a few glitches! Like shows playing in a different language....the same movie being posted more than once! I agree with another review that maybe we shouldn't get charged as much or at least have the app free for a month and a lower rate for the next few months until they work out all the glitches! Other than that I love this app! I do hope that they will add new movies or shows once in awhile as well!,2019-11-19 22:17:18,4
"In no good conscience should anyone support a streaming service that makes you pay $35 extra for ""premium titles"". Already being behind performance with its competition (such as no next or restart buttons in its interface, or no good way to navigate content within viewing or without), I by no means can provide anything good to say about Disney+.",2020-09-12 23:21:39,1

"Good app, great quality streams. My only complaints right now is that the complete Star Wars movies are not there as well as the complete Marvel Universe movies. Can't wait for the new TV shows they are promoting and for the rest of the collections to come in, but the total selection of tv series and movies just doesn't seem complete right now so it's tough to justify another service until it is.",2019-11-15 00:10:59,3

App is up and running now",2022-10-22 02:18:57,3

"The content is fantastic but the app is awful. I have to restart it between viewing episodes otherwise it claims to have technical issues & wont play anything or respond. Sometimes that doesnt even work & I have to disconnect & reconnect to the internet before it will load.

"Obviously a good platform due to the Disney content which will only get better. The only reason it isn't a 5/5 rating is due to some minor user issues. There is no ""continue watching"" recommendation, the service will occassionally pause randomly and load, and after pausing the screen remains frozen until the audio catches up. It is a brand new platform that is about 2 weeks old by the time writing so these minor grievances will likely be ironed out. Ultimately, Disney + is recommended",2019-11-22 02:22:53,4

There is constant buffering while I'm watching, it doesn't automatically go to the next episode, sometimes I have to open and close the app 3 and 4 times before it loads.

The default brightness is far too low in this app on my phone, even with my screen brightness turned up all the way it is almost impossible to tell what is going on in a dark setting such as a dimly lit room or alleyway in a movie. All i can see are faint silouettes of characters. If there was a brightness/gamma setting available in the app it would solve this issue immediately.

But what it's missing is resume in Watch feature. For example when you watch a TV show it will not remember what episode you were on if you close the app. Another negative is buffering at the start of shows can take a couple of seconds longer then other apps but I imagine this will all get sorted in time.",2019-11-17 01:38:22,4

"I love Disney plus and is an AMAZING app, but as you can see I gave it 5 stars, and here's why. All of the movies are in English and there are multiple options in the subtitles if you don't speak English. The app is easy peazy to use and there is absolutely no trouble finding a movie. The only thing I find irritating, is the fact there there ISN'T a free trial, so if your going to like it or not it's really a 50/50. Over all I think his is a great app and I highly recommend it!😊🥳",2020-12-19 17:20:14,5
"Really need an option to rate the shows and movies that users have already watched, also would LOVE an option to hide or dislike shows so I don't have to see the Kardashians on the home page every time I use the app. These are basic features that should already be available as they are on most platforms. A better filtering system would be preferable as well.",2022-07-18 19:57:49,1

I would highly recommend especially during these tough times!",2020-04-11 20:57:45,5
App works perfectly but Disney+ is nowhere near Netflix in terms of content. I have signed up for the year so let's see if they start to add more but at the moment it's fairly static nothing new added when you go in each day. On the other hand when you go into Netflix they've something new everyday.

"Hi there. I recently downloaded the app for my tablet. It is a Lenovo yoga 2 with SO 5.0.1 I CAN open the app and navigate everything. But, I CANNOT watch it. I mean, it stays there.. like buffering with the whirling thing.. and never start. It is frustrating. I don't want to watch a movie from my cellphone. Do you think it is a bug or something related with compatibility? Hope to hear from you soon",2021-01-29 12:25:29,1

"Constantly crashes, can't get it to cast to the TV, downloads require you to connect to the internet to play them rendering the feature completely pointless, terrible unintuitive interface, difficult to sort / find content, etc. Not a patch on the Netflix app and there's no reason it shouldn't be as good.",2021-08-10 17:36:12,1
"Rating the app on its current performance. I've had the app since Disney plus launched and its always worked perfectly. But today, for some reason none of the shows are loading.

Takes ages to load and glitches audio and pictures don't play,2024-04-24 06:00:25,1
1. The app doesnt let you download episodes and movies when you leave the app. So you have to stay on disney plus while your things download 2. You cant open the app when theres no internet connection. Ive had this problem way too many times. Also the only chance you have playing your downloads is either disconnecting from any internet connection you have or you have a great internet connection. For some reason if your connected to slow internet doesnt let you play your downloads.,2022-11-14 21:01:21,1

The when using it with wifi I'm not allowed to login to my account because there's been ""an error' to try again later. I can use it just fine on a laptop through Google Chrome but with the app on my phone, it's just horrific.",2021-12-08 18:24:54,1
Missing many functionality features. There's no way of selecting a different episode while watching another. Movie doesn't pause when you hit the spacebar. It does not remember your place when you're watching a TV show so if you've forgotten where you are in a series you have to scroll through and manually figure it out. Not an easy way to navigate to the main screen of TV shows. Needs a lot of tune up . What was Disney thinking not having the basic features of their competitors?,2020-10-17 17:36:18,3
"Consistent IP address issues (on disney+'s side, trust me we looked into it!) and dodgy playback such as shows and movies fastforwarding randomly and skipping audio. Random disconnections. Overall so disappointed as i was really looking forward to this subscription but it's turned out to be too unreliable or just inaccessible. Would love to be a customer again one day, assuming these major issues are dealt with properly!",2020-07-08 21:44:11,2
"Even with a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra the app takes forever to load. Screen times out 4 or 5 times, sometimes more (30 seconds before screen times out). Ridiculous, does not matter if wifi or data connection. The app is ridiculously slow. Amazon Prime loaded up nearly instantly for comparison. So did Google TV. Paying so much for an app that won't even open is ridiculous.",2022-06-08 22:45:04,1
"Shows sometimes disappear when searching for them and then one day they reappear (even when they are supposed to be available in your country). Downloading does not happen in the background (i.e. app must be open) and when you play downloads, more often than not they give an error that you're not connected to internet despite them being successfully downloaded. It's very frustrating.",2021-10-05 19:32:27,3
"Disney+ is great, the app is miles behind Netflix. It has now stopped saving where I watched up to so I have to remember the time every time I stop watching anything partway through (brilliant!!!), it doesn't allow me to start playing the next episode either as the previous one is finishing. With all their money, come on Disney I just want the basics!!!",2021-03-04 18:59:04,3
"Content is great, but the app features are below average. - You can't continue to watch over the top of other apps - It's not compatible with the pause & play button on head phones - The on screen play/pause is too small/close together - Recently watched/continue watching shows appears so far down the home screen I have only been using the app for about 2 weeks, seems to run without issues but needs work.",2021-10-22 02:57:55,3
"No working without internet connection. I've saved some TV shows to watch off-line. And each time I'm without wi-fi or data Movil on, my account automatically log out, regardless, if I don't come back to a place to connect my wi-fi or turn on my data Movil, I can't watch off-line, one of the main reason to hire this service. Watching off line.",2021-03-10 05:26:26,2
It's got good content but it's let down by the app. Many times the app is running very slow or it doesn't connect to anything or it's not working so you can't watch anything. It would also be good if you could include a liked or watched button because you keep recommending things to watch. If you're recommending things to watch then it should be tailored to the individuals preferences.,2021-05-28 18:38:14,3
"The content is amazing but the app Is awful. I've lost count of the amount of times I have had to uninstall and reinstall in hope that it will sort out the faults.

Good on you Disney...",2021-09-28 04:40:47,5

Otherwise great selection of programs and films.",2022-12-01 09:05:32,2

Doesn't remember what season of a show I'm on. Says continue watching on an episode I've gotten to the end of. Need to connect first to access offline downloads?? Where is the logic??

Disney plus app started off really well but recently it's gone downhill drastically. It always buffers and struggles to play content on my Samsung tablet and if I try and download anything it stops working completely.

"This app is not supported on ps3. I did not like the format or how the videos were organized. The video would buffer for an extended period, the the sound would continue while the picture was frozen. I got the 1 week free trial, tried to cancel, after going through pages and pages on their website I finally thought it was canceled. Until the next month when another charge came off my account. No refunds. Would not recommend, there are plenty of other streaming apps",2020-01-02 09:53:10,1
"App (and service itself) is very very raw yet. - Takes longer to load than Netflix. - No option to skip to next episode. - Doesn't remember where i stopped last time. - Search is only for correct spelling. Example: tried to search to Duck Tales, it did not find anything, just black screen. Had to type Ducktales. - No search for a theme. Like Christmas movies, etc. - No ""Continue watching"" list. I had to search for the show again. The only plus is old Disney films, like Cinderella. Unsubscribed",2019-11-19 18:10:58,2
"Not great, I have a Samsung Tab S7 Plus and an s21 plus so one of the latest, every other streaming app works great apart from Disney plus.

"I'm not sure who to contact, but for 2 months now the app doesn't work right on my tv, when I select something to watch it just sits at black screen and doesn't load, I've deleted and reinstalled, it's not my connection cause everything else works on the tv. I'd really like my money back from those 2 months, if not I might cancel my subscription",2020-03-06 18:13:04,1
"Not a bad app. Lay out is nothing special, a clone of Netflix. Lots of nostalgic movies/TV if you were a kid in the early 90s which is nice. One big draw back for me anyways is this app is only available for newer devices. I have a iPad 4th gen and can't download the app or watch it on any browsers, without an update to iOS 11 or newer, which 4th gens and older can't update to. However all my other streaming apps work fine Netflix, prime, crave, in that respect it's a big let down.",2019-11-13 04:59:08,3
"It does not let me access the downloaded content when offline, unless I login first (online) and I go offline afterwards. When I try to access the Android navigation bar while I'm watching a movie, there is no way I can prevent the app media control (i.e. play, pause, back, forth) from being activated and consequently the movie's location from being changed.",2021-03-24 22:26:26,1
Will get more stars when they fix the apps inability to chromecast properly it's always glitchy when it is casting and horrible to get connected.

Won't even install on my boys samsung tablets that are less than 2 years old. Meanwhile Netflix runs perfect with minimal battery drain, never crashes, and also Netflix runs on the boys tablets.

"Amazing that such a wealthy company can't make a better app. 2 issues I have are: 1) The downloads stop when the screen locks or you wanna do something else! How ridiculously poor haha it makes it unuseable - I will be immediately cancelling for this alone. 2) it will randomly download episodes without any care for there order. And then it sometimes will just not download the next episode even after you remove all the other downloads. Waste of space, sort it out disney",2022-12-10 00:13:38,1

Annoying okay so when you can watch the show, you can't pause it, it just keeps playing, you just tap tap tap your phone and it just plays, doesn't show the line of how long you've been watching, it just plays the stupid film.

On the actual website it shows that I have a subscription through Google Play but the subscription does not show up in my subscription list on Google Play. Having an extremely hard time trying to figure this out. I've contacted Disney+ and they told me to contact Google and Google says they can't do anything either as it doesn't show up on my account. I've been billed for it, and the service still allows me to stream. I've removed all payment information on my Google Play account in order to stop the streaming service for next month but it's quite inconvenient that I can't just cancel it through Google Play even though my Disney+ account shows that it's through Google Play.",2020-02-20 05:40:12,1

But phone app is about as bad as you can get....worste part is I pay money to not be able to use the app, considering 80% of my watching is on the road on my phone!",2021-07-05 13:14:55,1
"Can't open the app anymore as everytime you do, you are faced with error messages. That isn't even to mention the fact that downloading anything is useless because the app won't start unless you have internet connection.

No amount of uninstall, reboot, install etc fixes it. Even the keyboard to enter the credentials doesn't work! Device it runs on and App are both up to date, so Disney can't makes excuses you need to update. For something that is paid for, best to cancel subscription as it currently doesn't work adequately.",2022-11-15 22:44:35,1
"App is great. Works fine if you have stable connection. There is just one huge problem. When you download anything to external storage, and I mean anything app becomes unusable. Takes really long time to load non-cached titles and takes forever to play title even the one you have downloaded. This does not happen when you download to internal storage only on SD card. So if you want to download for offline watching you better have large internal storage.",2023-08-08 07:36:56,3

Also when you go to choose an episode it always resort to season 1 rather than the season you are currently on. Otherwise the content is good, not as plentiful as netflix but maybe I'm bias as I do not watch the children shows.",2021-07-28 15:19:32,3
"pretty decent app. The ""download to watch offline"" option could be better.. The downloading function itself works well, and pretty quickly, too.

"I think Disney Plus lacks well behind all the other streaming platforms (except maybe Amazon Prime but it has other benefits). Mainly because it is hard to navigate, the next episode button sometimes just disappears and it has no miniplayer whatsoever completely annihilating multitasking.

"This app outright lies about its features. It will tell you that it has the ability to do something (like window mode), but then when you follow the instructions it doesn't work. It also never updates you on when new things will be added, and honestly Disney+ feels like an app that the company slapped together to compete with other streaming services and then just never went back to it after it's release. You can feel the lack of care put into this thing and it's insulting.",2021-11-15 19:28:17,1

"Content is fine. But this is by far the worst user interface of any streaming app I have used. Clearly it is not designed for users who ""binge"" content. It doesn't give you the option to skip intros, 3min recaps of episodes you just watched, or 8min post episode credits. Make sure you don't watch anything that has more than one language, otherwise you'll have entire scenes with a subtitle saying ""foreign language used"" and be completely left out of this trivial thing called ""the plot"".

"Content good. The app itself is horrendous to use continue watching should be the very first row of tabs. When you click the show you want it immediately starts it rather than give you a second menu to continue or skip an episode like Amazon or Netflix, however instead you have to search it then click to open it then you can start watching it very long winded process. It also constantly crashes or fails to open",2021-12-12 21:35:07,3
"The app is very unreliable. Going to a show to view all episodes or starting an episode, you don't know what will happen when you click on the lower part of the episode. Going backwards or forward absolutely doesn't f*ing work. Casting is sometimes there sometimes not.

While scrolling through the run time at the bottom of the screen it appears the point you are scrolling to it out of sync as the image beside the scrolling run time and once you have selected it are 2 different scenes or seconds/ minutes apart. 2. Had a small glich where the subtitles were off and there were no subtitles appearing on screen but the on screen words were subtitled in German, it took me selecting another language's subtitles and then turning them off again",2021-03-06 14:15:56,4

"As Disney content, its quite nice with some old classics and some of the newer ones. As an app it kinda sucks a little bit for few reasons: 1. When you watch an episode and want skip the post credits and go back to home. It will not register that you've completed episode & will show what you've just watched 2. No trailers - this should be a given 3. Some content are very short like the secret wars (4min long!)",2020-04-01 07:26:52,3
"How the hell does your app still take 5 minutes to buffer a movie thats been downloaded?? I thought the problem was with my phone but all other apps have zero service issues while I go back to Disney and sure enough it struggles to buffer and play a movie downloaded to my phone, and even after playing starts randomly freezing at odd points. Almost feels like even in offline mode its still trying to find service, of which my phone shows isnt an issue lol",2020-09-13 01:26:48,3
The app fails to save my progress everytime. So I have to look for the episode and fast forward to wherever I was before. Selecting episodes is not that easy on PC as the list goes sideways instead of the traditional top down or list menu. So difficult to choose specific episodes. You have to click on series info as it's not available anywhere else. Could you please just copy Netflix interface and features.,2022-04-03 11:00:58,1
"Worst streaming app I've ever used. Connecting to Chromecast may or may not work. Group watch doesn't work anymore, app crashes instantly when changing episode. Lacks very basic functionality found in every other streaming app in existence. One of the most annoying things for me is the inability to access the episode list when watching an episode - switching episodes becomes extremely cumbersome, esp. if you start an episode from the home page, as you can't just go back to the show's own page.",2023-03-08 20:40:44,1

The subs stay miniscule and this makes the service nearly useless to me.",2022-04-08 00:07:34,1

Not easy to arrange this whilst kids are trying to watch in the back of the car during journeys.

I've tried for about 45 minutes now to watch something and no matter what I try it won't cast. At least there was a free trial so I didn't have to waste any money on it.",2019-11-19 00:54:08,1
"It used to be my favourite streaming service app , I used to be able to watch my downloads on long drives or whenever I was bored and didn't have access to my TV. Now the app doesn't even let me get past the disney+ logo before I'm being told the app isn't responding . I tried deleting the app and reinstalling to log back in but it doesn't even let me get to the log in page . It usually works fine on my TV except the odd error message maybe a few times a week ,but it doesn't even open on phone",2022-11-03 06:08:35,1
"I really loved this app up until a few days ago, since than the app won't load the screen even after doing everything possible, I got really frustrated when I downloaded a content and it didn't let me watch it without internet, this just doesn't make any sense. When I finally got the app to open one time yesterday, my movie kept pausing without me pressing any buttons or anything else open in my cellphone. I'm just frustrated and hope it gets fixed soon.",2021-06-27 21:36:33,2
"App is trash with chromecast, takes multiple times to get something playing. Never remembers the shows that I'm watching or saves at the correct episodes. Chromecast is the only way I watch streaming services, so I'm obviously not paying for a service that can't run basic features. Disney also doesn't care to fix these bugs, the app has been trash for years.",2023-09-19 16:04:54,1
"Generally I have found the app ok, but since the start of August I am unable to open it on Android. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but the issue persists. From looking at other reviews it appears I'm not alone. Despite this issue being around for 10 days, Disney don't appear to be acknowledging it, and there is no information on when it will be fixed. The latest update was meant to improve streaming experience and has failed miserably.",2021-08-08 20:24:25,1
"It does it's job. If you have Disney+ you can watch Disney, most Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and some other ""Star"" films and TV shows. Ultimately, between Netflix, Prime and Disney+, we couldn't afford them all and we used Disney+ the least. The ""Star"" shows are pushing it in the right direction but still didn't feel it was worth keeping at the moment and needed to cut on costs - the app is solid though and works well.",2021-04-02 08:08:00,4
"Previous issue has been fixed. It was working really well for a while with no issues. However, now videos tend to fast forward through some of the shows on it's own by 10 seconds to a minute which is really annoying. Especially when I rewind yo go back to where I was, then it buffers forever.",2020-03-25 00:51:37,1
"App stopped working on my android tablet. Started to get constant error messages about not being able to connect. Now it won't do anything apart from say error code 83. I've checked that code and it's to do with compatibility. My device is compatible and I have been using the app no problem until last week, so don't know why all of a sudden it won't work",2022-10-17 16:10:34,1
"Wow! What a mess! Old videos (Simpsons) and new (Noelle) cache, hang, and fail. Same failure on two different phones. Xbox app works as expected (no memory of what was watched but at least it plays). Cleared app cache and data but still fails the same. Update: after the updates the app is better and more reliable. Hanging circle only shows up when I play anything with a USB C adapter connected to HDMI and external TV.",2019-12-18 05:52:07,3
"Weigh the Cost. Try it for a month and see how much you want to watch. I found myself forcing content after my initial honeymoon period. Technical problems. It says Android 5 is the minimum supported OS. I have a OnePlus 6t with Android 11. I cannot play nor download anything on my device! I rely on my chromecast at home... It used to work fine, then Disney stated in my support ticket that my device isn't supported any more and a fix will be out in a week. Well, I'm still waiting. Please fix!",2022-07-11 17:38:31,2
"The app is ok, but with some technical issues that clearly need to be dealt with (based on the comments I've read). I've been trying to use the download (to watch offline) feature and it's been impossible. 12mb is the max amount of data downloaded after 2 days on WiFi. That's the only issue I've had so far, but I'll update after a week.",2022-11-22 00:08:56,3

"This is a real good app. I have rated it 4 stars because the following updates need to be completed and features should be done (doesn't affect the rating :) but would like to see it). Updates: 1. Bug Fixes When opening the app it automatically closes and comes up with an error (""An Unexpected Problem Occurred"") When playing a video it buffers all the time and I have a real good internet at home so that it doesn't buffer 2. Performance Increase The app takes too long to load a video and the internet I have is super fast. So this should be faster. Features: 1. Dark and Light Mode 2. Option for video quality change option 3. Design Change is needed it is too outdated. If I see the updates complete I will change this review so 5 stars and change the writing. Stay Safe!",2021-01-01 12:37:31,4
"It's gone really bad keeps telling me I'm offline or not connected to internet when i am and after opening and closing it 4 or 5 times it works. Then half the content is missing no pictures just grey boxes without pictures. Its doing this on everything tv, phone and laptop. Just ungraded to the top fibre package i can get and still the same, loads of error codes all the time been doing this for a month and a half now I keep using groupwatch to and its just tragic for both parties using it.",2022-12-21 17:07:52,1

The content is first class The app is useless. To get it to work you have to uninstall it then install it again every time you want to use it again and whats with the download to play it off line? Once downloaded it requires you to be online to start watching the downloaded content. Very frustrating if Disney+ can fix these issues it would more than likely get a 5 star rating,2021-08-20 06:54:50,2
"Your experience is usable, but there are a lot of issues. Whne downloading videos, sometimes the app forgets them somehow and requires you to re-download them, although they are still stored. App crashes a little too much. Videos can stop streaming sometimes if you skip through the playback, requiring you to stop and start playback again. In general, there won't be problems if you just pick a video and watch it. Don't skip around too much. Streaming quality and selection is very good.",2021-02-06 08:07:13,3

"App is ok but it needs a lot of polishing, when watching more than one episode it always plays the intro and recap on the following episodes, really annoying when binge watching. Also when casting the app does not stay live on the phone, this means it's difficult to pause or stop the programme when needed. The app needs to work at the same level as Netflix, that is the standard.",2022-12-08 09:03:51,3
"Probably the worst performance of any streaming service I've used. I have a 500Mbps low latency full fibre connection, so I know it's not my connectivity. I have tested it through a TV, an nVidia Shield and a Sky Q Silver device: all exhibit a large delay in streaming Disney and updating Disney programme lists, but no other streaming service suffers such delays through the same devices and internet connection.",2022-12-14 22:03:19,2
"Lots of good movies, especially with the addition of stars but I have to log in EVERY TIME I USE THE APP and it can be open, I swap to write a text to a friend, go back to continue my show or movie and I have to sign in again. It's annoying as I dont always have a hand free long enough to type in my info. Otherwise no issues here, love it but that one problem is worth 2 stars taken off.",2021-04-12 00:54:16,3
"Great selection, awful app, it is constantly freezing, not loading, both on my phone and when I Chromecast, not sure if it's a comparability issue, bit I don't have the same difficulties with other streaming services. Really disappointing given how big Disney is, surely they can invest a little more into getting their app working properly.",2022-09-14 12:30:23,2
Rubbish. Slow. Laggy. Doesn't sync with lips. I've downloaded for a holiday with no internet. Couldn't even open the app to view downloaded stuff. Shouldn't advertise that if it's not true. I'm on my 4th uninstall and download after it wouldn't open in about a month. Skips episodes on auto play. Only shows first 50 of my favourites so I can't browse films or TV. Not user friendly at all. Wouldn't pay for it. Currently on a free trial. Oh yeah. And you have to PAY £20 ON TOP for new films!!!!!!,2021-09-08 20:01:15,1

The ""Collections"" are incomplete 4. The thing I hate the most for sure, I can't access to movie features unless I search it, because if I click it on my Continue Watching it just start to play, sometimes my daughter doesn't finished the movies and she wants to restarted it.",2021-06-24 23:02:46,2
"I like the idea of being able to watch my childhood favourite however the app is really glitchy. When I'm trying to watch some thing itll flicker between black and what's meant to be showing or the video will freeze while the audio continues or the whole this will freeze in general. I'll try closing and reopening the app, going on and off the video yet the problem persists to the point where i just give up. I would also love and option to adjust the playback speed i.e 2x faster like youtube does",2020-06-29 02:17:33,2
The app caused me to double pay my first month's subscription after the trial period and I've been trying to get my money back for 2 months. Google is telling me it's Disney+ problem to fix and Disney+ is telling me its Google's problem to fix. Neither big Corp wants to help me out and I've wasted hours of time trying to get my $$ back. I'll be looking to give Google Play (where I first downloaded the app) a 1-star or less rating as well. What a joke. I've never had this problem with Netflix.,2020-01-07 23:31:45,1
"It's early days yet, and this app isn't quite as polished as other, longer serving streaming apps. Weird artefacts on the play control on screen graphics, shows stay in Continue Watching despite having run to the credits, shows on the Watchlist disappearing after a certain number of titles, random dropouts that require signing in. Bugs need fixing but otherwise a functional app. I just expected Disney to release an app that was a little more refined, given their usual stringent Quality Control",2021-08-08 10:37:24,4
Not yet really useable - they need more time to be in the same league like other streaming apps. Compared with other streaming apps like Netflix or Amazon the usability is really fast away. App crashed. Won't stream a video after an error for some time. If it wouldn't be the content I wouldn't have kept it. Even Sky mobile App is better.,2021-04-10 12:07:54,2
"For a multibillion company, this app is poop. If you don't opt for autoplay, it is such a pain to try and play the next episode when casting. You have to manually find the series and scroll to the next episode and choose it. If I want to watch downloaded episodes on the move I have to choose the episode and lock then unlock my phone for them to play. Why?! *Edit, apologies if you want to play a download, you have to turn your mobile data and WIFI off or you're met with a black screen.",2023-07-26 19:58:41,1
"App worked great up until about July then error code after error code. IT is ZERO help saying my internet is too slow yet works fine on TV and iphone (who wants to watch movies on a phone.. not me). Have deleted the app, logged out of all accounts etc which IT told me to do, did not work. This app needs fixing, its almost like they used the same interface they use for everything Disney related... fastpasses, my disney experience, etc. Downloading doesnt even work. Get it together Disney!!!!",2020-08-28 16:34:17,3
"Compared to Netflix, the way the actual app works isn't as good. There are quite a few frustrating things, like not being able to minimise and play in the background on mobile, if you want to switch episodes there is no ""go back an episode"" or ""go forward an episode"" option, or even an exit out of the episode to the episode list instead of how it currently exits an episode to the homepage. Very slow loading times on TV. Content is okay but not phenomonal(yet, anyway).",2022-05-18 03:34:25,3
"PS4. Love the content. Hate the app. It needs a full design overhaul. Annoyingly unresponsive; Can't look at a show's episode list from the ""continue watching"" section (which often doesn't change to the next episode); ""pause/play"" [ x button] has to be pushed multiple times to pause or play instead of responding on one (or maybe two) clicks; The subtitles don't show most of the time; We've been paying for this since day 1, but the lack of quality of life updates is super frustrating!!",2021-02-24 14:06:02,2
Meh could be better. I mean its still in its infancy and like most streaming services it favours their American based customers more. It doesn't have all the xmen movies yet but the OG 90s cartoon so saving grace there. Also it will remove items you have watched but be careful as if you watch a series to finish it will tick back to episode 1 of season one and it will be stuck in your watch list forever.,2020-04-14 14:00:08,3

Unfortunately, after that time, the video freezes with the audio continuing to play. I've uninstalled then reinstalled, used mobile data instead of WiFi (so I know its on your end and not my connection) and closed and reopened the app several times. Not working. For such a big company, this is shameful.",2021-05-17 00:08:09,1
"Wauw, this just doesnt work in Europe! Such a shame...i paid a year upfront without testing it, since NF works fine here. Im in Greece right now, with fast 4G/5G on my phone. (60mbps on a good day). Netflix in 4k on multiple bigscreens works fine. However, Disney just sucks. Movies hang. App doesnt even open sometimes, it just hangs on the home screen trying to get content. I understand the whole world wide server thing is extremely difficult to setup, and Disney's new, but still. Fix it!",2021-08-24 05:27:18,1
"Great. Basically includes everything I'm missing from Netflix. Unfortunately doesn't include the (Marvel) Spiderman movies, obviously just to be annoying. The video player itself also feels low budget; rewinding even 10 seconds incurrs a loading sign which lasts around 5 seconds every time. This is follwed by a lag and sometimes the stream even stops completely. Disney have plenty of room for improvement here. Hopefully they don't dawdle.",2020-04-07 22:05:52,4
The movie selection is fair but it freezes constantly! I have unlimited high speed Wi-Fi and this freaking movie app is ALWAYS freezing and reloading. I am NOT impressed with it and i have paid for the year. I will NOT be renewing. At least Netflix loads properly and never freezes. I would not recommend this new movie/tv site to anyone!,2019-12-01 03:55:02,1
"A long way to go until it competes with the UX of other streaming apps. Your watchlist isn't on the front page, no quick way to skip credits or the next episode countdown, VERY clunky episode selection for anything later than season 1, feels like I have to restart my phone on a daily basis because the app stops recognising my Google Chrome, and the app keeps logging me out randomly. A chore to use, which I'll remember when I run out of new content and cancel my subscription.",2021-03-07 00:39:41,3
Pretty useless. Still has a lot of work to be done. App doesn't work flawlessly. It takes forever to load and buffer on the app. I haven't tried it on my smarttv or laptop yet. Thank God it's a free trial. I might just cancel the subscription before they charge me and just wait till they fix the kinks.,2019-11-13 09:10:00,1

TV works with the competence (sorry for the comparison). So. What I should do?",2019-12-17 10:58:44,1

"It's ridiculous that none of my downloaded shows play when I'm offline. If Netflix can do it then Disney plus should be able to. Disney has the option it just doesn't work. Also, it should be able to do what Netflix does and make the screen small so you can do other things while you're watching your show. It should have a minimize option. In this day and age we all need to be able to multitask",2021-05-16 04:20:52,3

By making it more user friendly and more accommodating to people, they're more likely to include you in their life overall.",2019-12-07 00:08:19,3
"The worst app ever!!! It doesn't travel with the user. Going into a different country should mean the ability to use the app only with different content and still being able to watch the company's original work. But with this app you can't.

Add to that, nit being able to subscribe again because for some unknown reason they won't send the ORP .. This app is not good",2023-02-14 07:12:42,1

Also I have noticed a big technical glitch when watching something on the app it's meant to remember where you stopped.

"Good content with great video and audio quality the problem is that it doesn't remember what you've watched in any way. If you have to stop a movie, you have to find it again in the lists and remember where you left off. Even more annoying is when your watching a series, you better remember exactly where you left off or have to watch the start of a few episodes before finding where you were at in the series.

I've lowered the star rating since last week. This APP is so bad for Disenys brand integrity. Really shouldn't have launched it until you had it right. What a massive disappointment to have all of the best disney movies and programmes at your fingertips for it to be ruined by buffering every few minutes.

"Didn't want to get it, felt like Disney were monopolising kids movies. But honestly, I find the app easier to use and has far more features than Netflix or Prime. For example, last night my partner and I and our friends were able to do date night all in different towns by using video calls and Disney's group watch feature. It has made Covid restrictions so much easier on our family. Just absolutely love it.",2021-04-10 09:43:12,5

But I have to say, this is literally my only issue so far. Aside from Disney messing with the Simpsons aspect ratio (but that's not your fault 🤣)",2019-11-20 22:51:21,3
Slick and good UI however a few issues: - The phone app is not in sync with the playstation app as when I watch a movie on the phone and want to continue on the playstation app it doesn't register that movies having been watched therefore cannot resume - Once an episode ends it doesn't let you go to next episode seamlessly compared to Netflix or Prime - Disney seems to be drip feeding episodes (one every week or so) instead of releasing whole seasons which is a little annoying,2020-04-09 11:05:18,2
Too many ads for such a large company. They have so much money and after you pay the fee to use the streaming service you still get ads. It's obnoxious and unnecessary.,2024-01-23 04:29:34,1

The bar displaying what you are watching disappears and you can not pause unless you re launch the app. 'Continue watching' isn't accurate to where you where up to and also still shows movies you've watched till the end. If you open a series you've previously watched or are in the middle of watching the episodes don't show as watched as they do on Netflix. App need to work correctly for those of us watching on devices and casting,2022-05-23 03:08:40,1
"Really quite awful. Episodes of shows are out of order or missing entirely. If you select an episode to watch there's no option to resume watching from that point... You have to start a series in its entirety to get that option. Seriously, look at your competition... They actually know what they're doing in comparison.",2019-11-21 09:16:33,1
"Stalls quite a bit (using Chromecast). Downloaded it for my son so he can watch the lion guard but they don't have the latest season and it doesn't have continuous play. You have to select the next episode after one ends. Once I pressed play for the next episode, it started casting the previous one again. This happened a couple of times. Otherwise, it's okay.",2019-11-20 23:06:12,3
"Overall, it has been an amazing experience to have Disney + streaming service. The are a few things that I may improve: -On ""continue watching"" to be able to access the previous episodes and not only the one I was watching. And maybe be able to access all seasons and episodes as well. -On my phone the app has really come in handy, although some times when I cycle from D+ to my other apps and back, the sounds is off and I can't control the volume anymore... Aside from that I am extremely happy!!",2021-01-16 20:16:39,4
"A great service with awesome content. I would like to offer some feedback for the Android mobile app. The list of continue watching always seems to disappear after a week or so except the most recently viewed. I would also appreciate a lock screen option to prevent accidental touching. A way to minimise the screen which still playing would be great to allow me to answer messages received while still watching. It frequently logs me out, which can be frustrating.",2021-05-27 12:01:44,3
"Obviously great library to choose from. Great originals especially the Marvel series are awesome. The app is a bit lack luster though - having finished an episode you first have to skip to the end to get to the next episode. The video quality of downloads varies within one download. and a couple of minor bugs overall you can't avoid this if you want Disney/Marvel content, but the app really just isn't great.",2021-12-23 09:13:30,3
"Content is amazing since Disney seem to own everything. However, the app itself needs a lot more work - a good start would be the whole ""Continue Watching"" section. ** Note the sarcasm - other platforms have these functions.** 1. Would it be too much to ask for the app to track episodes/scenes where you've left off? 2. Need an option to clear things off the continue watching list. Mostly b/c the app enjoys saying I have a few minutes left on a movie but I've let the credits run.",2021-12-11 05:16:59,3
Update: Some companies just shouldn't be in the streaming business. This app is a perfect example. Downgrading from 2 stars to 1 star _________________ 1. Very very low volume over Google TV. It's in audible even with the soundbar at full volume. 2. Shows don't allow you to skip to the next episode until the full credits play out - some of those last for 5 mins especially for the mini series. 3. If you're scrolling on a list there isn't an option to jump to search while using the Google remote,2022-07-09 03:06:57,1
"Specifically to PS4 and Xbox, we no longer see a continue watching list, unfortunately.",2024-02-04 02:35:14,4
"App hasn't worked properly since the last Android/OneUI 3.0 update from Samsung. Either the content won't play or attempting to play will crash and reboot my phone. Surely Disney should have the resources to keep up with compatibility! Restarting my phone seems to help, as long Disney+ is then the first app I use. Other than this deeply egregious bug, the app does exactly what you'd want it to do.",2021-05-02 12:39:07,3
"I would love to give this app a five star rating because I love almost everything about it. My favourite things in one place, Marvel and Disney, it lets me discover new favourites. The only downfall I've found is that you can't have it playing in the background like you can on things like the Netflix and NowTV apps. If you get a message or want to check Facebook, etc, you have to come off the movie/TV show and then go back to it after. If it played in the background it would definitely be a 5.",2020-03-25 18:11:02,4
"Deleted previous review to add more feedback: screen brightness within the app is significantly lower than phone screen brightness. If I compare to Netflix for example, the contrast and brightness there is much better and provides a much clearer image. Night scenes are therefore very difficult to see. Edit: LG webOS smart TV feedback. Regularly experiencing long buffer times especially in the evenings. Cross checked against Netflix at those times and no problems. Also checked router.",2019-11-01 18:01:05,3
Connection drops and app crashes frequently. No other streaming service we use does this,2024-02-10 13:54:19,2
"App not much to be desired. Such a badly designed app, it's so bad when you're casting to your TV, it wont resume a show. It will always start the show or movie from start and most times it wont even start casting. To many times do I need to restart the app until it works. Of all the different streaming apps i use, non have issues",2021-02-23 20:55:17,2
"my app is stuck on Spanish, and I can't find a language setting",2024-03-29 18:44:05,2
"When pausing a series, playing afterwards disrupts the auto-play for the next episode. Annoying. Not being able to skip to the next episode is a little annoying too. Decent range of content, but the app on phone (and PlayStation) is buggy and cuts out a fair amount. There are some things that other streaming services get right, Disney+ should take note and build them in as well",2022-06-14 12:32:20,3
"If i choose to download into external storage, the app will not be able to play the video & the app will crash. I can only download into internal storage in order to watch the video. I'm currently using my Android phone and cast it on my TV using google Chromecast. The problem is after every episode, it doesn't auto play the next episode. I have to use my phone to play the next episode. The control at the bottom of the screen should also include ""previous/next episode"" in addition to skip 10s.",2021-06-02 12:13:42,3
"Edit: The issue was fixed after the latest update for the app in WebOS. Subtitle English CC keeps disappearing for tens of minutes even though it's turned on still. It will refuse to actually work for a while. It's really frustrating. This is happening on the newest version of Web OS, LG C2 OLED. Obviously I tried everything. Reinstalling the app, resetting the TV, changing to different subtitles and back to EN, setting up the subtitle settings in the mobile app, but the issue still persists.",2023-06-05 13:58:50,5
"I like the catalogue of content. A few gems missing in terms of Disney Channel shows but alright overall. My issue is there's no way to edit my watch history, like if I start to watch something and then don't wanna finish it, it just sits in my 'continue watching' unless I finish it which by doing so messes with the algorithm. Also, Disney+ is the only streaming service I have that won't cast to my TV or ChromeCast. I'm not sure what the problem is but please look into it.",2020-02-16 02:41:30,4
"Not only does it not run properly on my ps4, to the extent its unusable, it now constantly messes up on my phone. God forbid you should want to rewind anything. If you do, ecpect it just completely mess up the app, and youll get about 1 sec of viewing, then 3 secs of the bufffer circle, over and over again until it crashes the app, or freezes your phone/ps4. Avoid! Dont pay the subscription price, as they seem to not want to do any work to make the app funtional, on any format.",2021-04-11 05:14:27,1
"Can't even use the app. When I would try to watch anything about 5-10 minutes in my whole phone would crash I have a LG G5. I've never experienced that before with my phone and I've had it for 3 yrs I then tried to use it on my laptop and nothing would load, it kept giving me a ""something is wrong right now try again later error code 83"". Nothing would work. Just got sick of trying to figure out why nothing was working. Maybe when the app is more improved I'll try it again. Very disappointing.",2019-11-21 00:40:42,1
"this app used to work well, though I didn't personally use it that much my family members used it regularly. Recently, like within the past month the app will not open on any of our devices (TV, tablet, phones etc). When the app did use to work it would sometimes stop the video you're watching and say an error has occurred. By far the worst streaming app, will not be renewing my subscription next month.",2022-12-28 18:19:05,1
"Do not work well with Chromecast, its just a trash comparing to Netflix. It does not matter if you have an amazing content but it does not work well with a simple and most used casting device. Another terrible problem is that it just stoped working after the update to the latest version. I really would like to give ZERO stars!",2022-11-12 18:51:55,1
"Such a frustrating app. After downloading one or two movies for the kids to watch offline the app becomes unusable. You tap something and the spinning thing comes up... wait for 5 minutes to respond, and repeat. The only way to make it usable again is to uninstall and reinstall. But then if you download something again it turns to rubbish again. The Netflix app on the same device (it's a Nokia T20 tablet) works perfectly.",2022-12-21 09:59:16,1
"Lacks in content, hopefully they will add more stuff and complete the collection of some film series they have, it's frustrating, when your watching a series and some films in between are missing, i.e. (X-men series is incomplete). Other than that it's a good app, works perfectly fine, aswell it should be, paying enough for it.",2020-04-02 23:13:09,3
"Great content! Needs more features: 1. Mine disconnects from chromecast every few episodes. I've got to connect something else like Netflix, then connect Disney again before it works. 2. When I've turned my screen off, and then I go back into the app, the episode or movie starts from the beginning again.",2019-12-04 03:07:32,3
"The app will not even load once. I have have reinstalled and restarted multiple times. I have a Google Pixel 2 XL running Android 10. Update: Emailed Disney+ got an automated email to try ringing or chatting. Went with chat, tried twice with Manuel and Pong. I was unresponsive apparently (I sent multiple messages). I am almost certain I was talking with bots. In summary, if you have problems with this just delete and ignore it.",2020-02-08 05:10:38,1
"Currently unusable. Frequent issues with the app scince the beginning. Keep getting error 83 for the last month on my android phone and Chromecast and will not login at all.

Found I need to start app while connected to internet, then I can go offline (airplane mode), but sometimes it looses it, if I pause movie it sometimes will say it needs internet to continue. Unreliable offline mode not much good if you are far far away from internet. I won't be renewing unless this gets fixed.",2021-09-06 18:24:46,1
I absolutely love the content in this app although there is constant issues with the shows loading and reloading and just not working the app constantly shuts itself off and just genuinely doesn't work the best. Will continue to use as I like the shows on it but wouldnt personally recommend to anyone.,2024-04-16 16:40:06,2
"Yes they have some great content but if the app won't play it - which far too often it is unable to - it becomes a mute argument...much like any decision you have to make about what to watch unless it's on another service of course. Interest speeds topi g out at 107 to 120 mbps, but it still freezes all the time....so frustrating. I would recommend binging what you must see and them ditching them as the app is concentrated frustration.",2023-08-13 02:55:13,1

Gets pretty irritating",2021-02-28 19:53:25,3
I like Disney plus itself. Unfortunately unlike Netflix you have to refresh your sign in to watch downloaded movies or episodes. This is a pain as sometimes you are in the middle of nowhere on a road trip and you can't watch the next episode because there is no internet. This needs to be fixed ASAP! This is why I only gave it 3 stars. Another problem is even when downloaded the app buffers and stalls the show I'm watching from time to time. Downloaded equals no buffering and no internet,2021-07-18 19:35:40,3
"Normally I would give full five stars, but they added ads, which is ridiculous in my opinions because we pay a monthly fee to watch a bug variety of movies WITHOUT any ads interrupting.",2023-12-07 15:13:18,3
"The app is good, easy to navigate and well suited for both mobile and television. So far, I've been having a pretty great experience! My only nitpick is that when wanting to download a movie on mobile it doesn't seem to show what the download size is unless it's from a TV series? Maybe I'm not looking hard enough, but in the details it doesn't seem to say. Otherwise, recommended!",2019-11-13 15:25:13,4
"Day 1 of subscription; Downloaded a season of a show to watch offline and it worked fine. Went to watch the show while I was offline, no internet connections available and I struggled to get the app to play anything. Was somehow able to watch the first 2 episodes after fighting with the app for 10 minutes each episode, restarted app and no longer works at all. The app will not play videos or accept the correct pin input and now will not log me in at all. This app is garbage. Waste of money.",2022-02-22 01:42:30,1
"How is it that on every device i own, on any corner of the planet, it takes 3 attempts to play a video without the app crashing or doing nothing for 5 minutes? This is the only app that malfunctions anywhere near this magnitude. Mind you this is an app full of children's content, which is not a patient audience. This is the ONLY video app that is this bad. And your menu UI is garbage slow. I'd say anyone involved in writing this app should be embarrassed, but you should never write code again.",2023-11-05 15:42:52,1

I mainly use Disney+ on my pc or ps4 without any issues, but literally (I've counted) 6/8 times I've tried opening the app, just to check if a show is in the library, the servers are down.

"This app signs me out frequently. Almost every time I want to watch something. Especially when I'm offline, trying to watch things I've downloaded. The whole point of downloading things is that I shouldn't have to use the internet or waste my data, but I have to almost every time I want to open the app and am forced to log in every time.

The damn movie would freeze for half an hour then it will only show me 5 minutes and freeze again.......so stupid. I do not recommend this app. Go back to Netflix lol that's what I did, if it was my phone then Netflix wouldn't work either but it runs perfectly.

Constantly logs you out and is an all around user unfriendly experience in compsrison to apps like netflix. Poorly keeps track of the shows you watch and will throw up an error almost 50% of the time you put it in the background causing you to have to type in your info again. Its only saving grace is the wide selection and the decent network connection.,2020-07-29 10:31:40,3
"Updated: Most of my early issues were launch/server load related. Have had a relatively good experience since. Still missing some features/polish that other streaming apps have, but that will come with time. Library is fantastic and quality of service is more than acceptable.

I notice Disney are collecting my subscription fee bang on time though, and I'm sure there will be no compensation or free month for me not being able to access the content I am paying for.

I would put more stars but the app is like its broken and I can't watch anything most of the time cause its stuck on the disney+ loading screen.,2022-05-30 11:40:45,3
The crashing of the app and the issue are just to much. I paid for the year already or I'd have just cancelled until the app gets its bug fixed. I understand it's a new app and it was done at launch so I'm not going to do a one star cuz I'm sure it'll get updated. When it works smoothly I'll definitely change the rating.

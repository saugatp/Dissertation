"Every time I try to play an episode, the video freezes while the audio keeps playing. I tried clearing cache, clearing data, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but nothing is working. Update 4/22/24: After leaving the app for a couple of months, I decided to try again. I managed to watch a couple of episodes uninterrupted, but now I'm getting the same issue again. The video freezes while sound keeps playing. This is ridiculous.",2024-04-23 03:56:49,1
"Netflix was the thing to watch ad free streaming at an affordable price. Then suddenly, they give u ads. In order to not have ads, u must pay more. They keep adding price stuff and making new rules. Netflix has gone down hill with the money grab. I refuse to upgrade as I got Netflix with tmobile (originally was ad free but Netflix changed the rules). The worst part is, I can't upgrade. I don't get the discount. Luckily the ads are rarely longer than 30 seconds. Do better.",2024-04-12 15:48:53,1
"Used to love Netflix. It had good shows, was reasonably priced, I could install a version on my phone and have entertainment while I was traveling, the whole family could share an account on different devices... sublime. But most recently, I've been getting kicked off every2 weeks. Netflix has decided I'm not allowed to use their platform that has BEEN PAYED FOR unless within their jurisdiction. If this had been disclosed before purchase, there wouldn't have been a purchase.",2024-04-07 15:18:17,1
"It stops shows after just a couple of episodes, which some people might find useful, but I can't figure out how to turn that off. I want to play shows for background noise while I'm painting, or cooking, or cleaning. I don't want to stop everything because I have to wash my hands so I can tell this stupid app that YES I AM STILL WATCHING. I got rid of this app before because of this, but certain shows are only on Netflix.",2024-04-19 00:28:49,1
"Great overall The reason why I gave 4 stars is because even though i've been using this app for 9 years now, I find it lose its meaning. What I mean is that other apps are upping their games, leaving Netflix as a weaker app due to the other apps buying more content. Amazing overall, recopmmend completely, however netflix, please buy more movies. That would help add that extra star.",2024-04-12 22:53:03,4
"I had no issues with app prior to the ads. Now when I download any movies to watch for later, they disappear at the beginning of the following month i.e., I downloaded 3 or 4 in March, only watched. As of today, the other 3 movies are gone. This happened in February as well so I thought it was just me but now I'm certain it's not. Please fix. Ty",2024-04-04 17:53:51,3
"When the EFF are you going to fix the brightness issues with Android?!? Multiple phones, multiple Android updates, multiple years! If you adjust or even accidentally touch the brightness control in the Netflix app, it breaks the brightness control. Your phone's brightness is overridden, the Netflix brightness doesn't work properly, and you literally need to clear the storage (not just cache) on the app to fix it. That's essentially uninstalling and reinstalling. How has this not been fixed yet!?",2024-04-03 07:14:07,3
"While I have enjoyed Netflix, I find it highly confusing how they get rid of good shows. To my perspective, I think it could resul more profitable to allow customers to be able to choose what we watch and like to keep around in stead of just stuffing the app with all sorts of nonsense options/movies/shows. Netflix used to be of better quality, meaning it used to have better content (more family oriented) and now it just seems to be aiming to delete the worthy of keeping fam oriented shows.",2024-04-14 06:32:58,2
"I've been trying to watch Netflix for 24 hours now, and it just won't start playback!! I've checked for updates, deleted my cookies, force quit the app, reinstalled the app, and nothing works. I have not made any changes to my subscription... the service simply isn't working. For the prices they're making us all pay, this is absolutely unacceptable. We can't even use the service we paid for, and I have premium.",2024-04-02 15:26:20,1
"For the most part, it was decent until recent changes. Recently our paid subscription changed to include ads. The ads show up every few minutes of streaming and last up to two minutes. It's very frustrating when our PAID subscription includes ads, especially with so many. I also wish there were more options for classic movies or TV shows, like Friends.",2024-02-10 03:05:16,1
"A new year, and a new price increase. Netflix averages an extra $1 in cost, every year. This is getting ridiculous. I may either cancel, or downgrade and then cancel. Update: more price increases and now netflix locks movies behind different paywalls. If you're on the wrong plan, even if Netflix carries the movie, you won't be allowed to watch it. This is a terrible service. Save your money and go elsewhere.",2024-02-24 09:46:30,1
"Out of every streaming service I have used,Netflix is hands down the slowest and poorest working, regardless of a high quality internet connection as well as current updates. Rarely can I consistently watch a show on Netflix, meanwhile I have no problems with Hulu or Disney+. You've been around long enough, maybe it's time to fix your speeds instead of your prices, Netflix...",2024-03-16 15:11:07,1
"Netflix keep getting worse and worse. Literally unusable for travel and offline downloads. Travelling a lot for work, this is the reason I have this sub, but now I can't use away from my home wifi or download for offline. I've subscribed to netflix for many years and suddenly I have to pay more for something unusable? Absolutely not. It's much more affordable to buy/rent the digital shows and movies you want from elsewhere. Cancelling greedy low quality Netflix completely. Netflix is a scam.",2024-03-11 15:58:21,1
"Netflix is the first app I bought. Movies,series, TV shows, yes, still more to choose from. Netflix was also first to ask if I liked what I had seen on the network. I had Netflix, and paid for it, 1 yr, before I figured out how to watch it on my tv, and how to get help to find out.I could always get it on my phone and tablet.I love Netflix. You can always find something to watch, and if you are in bind, the network also has suggested programming, using past watching.",2024-02-08 04:39:06,5
"This app just seems to get worse. I LOVED Netflix at first especially due to the anime and tremor movies, even all the old classics and even new things! But now the app is so glitchy and I can no longer use picture in picture which means I can watch it while doing other things on my phone. I've went into my settings on multiple occasions and it's not my phone, it's the app. They also keep removing movies left and right such as my favorites which is the only reason I got this app.",2024-03-17 00:18:40,2
Netflix could not possibly make it harder for a household of two to use their service. If you're not a single person with one singular device then goodluck. Update: also recently upgraded to ad-free so that we could cast to a TV. It's ridiculous that you can't cast with ads. I guess Netflix would prefer that people (under same household of course) huddle around a cell phone screen if they're not on board with price increases. Every other competitor doesn't have these kinda issues.,2024-03-07 16:27:24,1
2/14/24 update - still awful. it still freezes every time I go out of what I'm watching to respond to a text I have to relaunch the app. December 2023- I've had Netflix for years but the more the price increases the more bugs this app has. honestly it isn't worth the price anymore with all the other options that are now available. it freezes constantly on both my TV and my phone. the options aren't as great as they used to be.,2024-02-14 15:22:08,1
"Netflix as a concept is great. Netflix as an app completely sucks. You can tell you're due for an app or device update because you get constant""5.10"" errors. Which would be fine if the updates fixed the problem. But they persist for days after. And the updates aren't exactly infrequent either. Doesn't matter if it's downloaded content or online. This is the most obnoxious app I have used to date.",2024-03-22 00:32:37,2
This app is getting worse by the week. Constantly have to log out and log back in to reset. It freezes up and buffers all the time. I have the most expensive wifi because we work from home. I don't understand it this service was never like this whats up? Do better!! But no problem raising the monthly fee. We watch other streaming services more because we don't want to mess with Netflix 😕,2024-03-26 19:41:56,3
"Avoid at all costs. I resubscribed to use Netflix while traveling. Now, the app won't even let me watch the shows/movies I downloaded before leaving for my trip. Also, I cannot stream anything because the app gives the error ""Netflix can't be used in this location"". So, I got scammed for $16 and I can't use the service at all. What a joke...",2024-04-23 03:55:35,1
"Netflix has changed a lot over the years, and it was at one point my favorite and had great selections, it was convenient and portable, so I could share with my family when I went to college. This is no longer the case, and they have changed very much on some of their selections and ideals when allow people to share accounts. Especially with family who may be going off to do something. If you want something nice just go to Hulu or Prime. The both give discounts on students and allow you to share",2024-02-09 01:17:30,1
"A shadow of it's formal self. Tons of content no one really cares for. A select amount of great content and originals. But the price increases, the ads, and the killing of series as they are trending are enough to lose a long time user. We soon as T-Mobile stops including it in their rate plans I'm out. If you don't get this for free don't start now.",2024-02-08 23:54:43,1
Just rejoined yesterday and no matter what I do I can't get Netflix to recognize my chromecast device no matter what I do. I've gone thru all the troubleshooting and nothing is working. All my other apps work perfectly fine with my chromecast. Gonna cancel Netflix because it has become absolutely worthless. I'm done trying to figure out why it's not working anymore.,2024-02-18 10:15:09,1
"This new update freezes my tablet and does not display the video. I can hear the audio. When I try to get out of the Netflix app, my tablet is frozen. I literally have to shutdown and restart. I tried all the troubleshooting tips including uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Nothing has worked. I have NEVER had the problem on my tablet. Galaxy 7 lite UI 6.14. It works fine on my iphone.",2024-03-08 16:13:15,1
"Update: I uninstalled and reinstalled the app with no change, I still cannot watch anything on my phone. Needs an update, please fix! After the last update I've had issues watching on my phone. I can cast to my google hub and it plays fine. I go back to viewing on my phone and it starts up fine but then it freezes, with the audio still playing. Did restart my phone, etc. But nothing seems to help.",2024-03-26 21:48:42,1
"Upgraded to premium for a better experience, but it's been the opposite. The 14-day device verification is a hassle, especially for a paid service! Even after upgrading, constant lockouts for my family members make the premium subscription feel pointless. Considering canceling as it doesn't deliver the expected benefits. Developers, please address these issues for a better user experience.",2024-02-19 07:52:44,1
"We've loved Netflix for at least 9 years straight. Had to make it a point to come back to thank you for what might seem trivial, but I loooove that you can lock your screen! Small, simple...but thanks! Y'all have always been awesome, and way more than fair on subscriptions...and still no commercials! Thanks for not selling out by selling us....",2024-04-24 21:46:56,5
"Terrible update. 2/17/24, and I cannot watch anything. I have been unable to watch anything since yesterday after I updated the app. It keeps spinning to load what I want to watch and never actually plays. The price increase to almost $26 makes this even more ridiculous and absolutely not worth keeping. Would not recommend anyone even bother with Netflix anymore. There are better and cheaper options that actually work.",2024-02-18 02:52:26,1
"You would think tiny glitches and audio mistakes would be taken care of by now. But for YEARS Netflix has been the absolute worst at trying to rewind, turning off audio descriptions, AND when you pause or ff or rewind, the audio becomes delayed for some reason. If you can't fix something so small, then I'm just going to have to unsubscribe because it's getting on my last nerve",2024-04-24 02:21:38,1
"Supposed to be the best. it is when it works but now it won't work on my brand new phone. it was working yesterday. no updates to cause this issue. why pay for premium service with Netflix when the app barely works an to tell me that it's my mobile network. i have pics- i utilized Netflix test Network connection, an it shows I'm connected to Internet, an server. t Mobile clarified it as well. the IT person on the phone at Netflix denied any possible app hacking, but all the signs show its hackd",2024-04-10 20:14:19,1
"Netflix used to work for me, and it was great! I loved binge watching and such, but now after the latest update for some reason it keeps telling me the my device is not part of the house hold, even though it's all payed for! Netflix disabled this pop up thing for a while, but now it's back. Plus they made it 2x more expensive which sucks. If Netflix expects me to support them again then the need to support us 👊!",2024-03-30 22:07:27,1
"Can't use Chromecast without ad-free plan. Fix it. Amazon prime still casts with ads. I guess Netflix app developers are inferior. From the Netflix website...

"2 days ago someone hacked my account and added themselves, charging me the premium. Now no matter how I try, I can't watch any shows, because the account INSISTS I have to add an extra person. I enjoyed Netflix for a long time, but this??? It took a phone call and it was fixed and a refund is being done. Thank you. I am once more a happy customer.",2024-02-14 15:32:32,5
"Netflix is trash. Ever since the latest update, I can't get it to work on my Oculus or my Samsung smart TV because apparently, neither of them support ads. Well, guess what the new update was so generous to put in everything. ADS, so now I have to? Upgrade my plan, which means? You guessed it PAY MORE MONEY. Just another way to con people into having to pay more for garbage. No thanks, I'll take my money elsewhere.",2024-02-09 04:04:10,1
"When I finally feel like trying the service out, it doesn't even allow for me to pay for a subscription through the play store. Netflix insists on either a credit card, or pay-pal, and I don't want to open a bank account just for a single streaming service. Pretty much every other streaming service on the play store allows me to subscribe through the play store, but Netflix just has to be petty and inconvenient",2024-02-25 04:44:26,1
"Ever since the added the option to restart on crash, it always crashes after being paused for a few minutes. It is also spammed with games nobody wants, and hides the titles of coming soon so that you are forced to watch the preview to see what it is. Also, the non-stop spam notifications to continue watching something or to ree a release you didn't even add to a list is annoying.",2024-03-04 03:52:07,1
"Pretty horrible. I paid more to add an account and they took the money but won't allow me to watch. The account cancels now in less than 2 weeks because its upsetting, so we canceled. Have been subscribed since 2010, my son and I, but Netflix has new rules so we obliged and they took my dollars and won't allow me to watch. Good riddance Netflix. Too bad you're so greedy.",2024-04-24 18:36:15,1

To use your mobile device to watch Netflix on your TV, you'll need to change to an ad-free plan."" Unilaterally changed the plan that I get with T-Mobile and added this little caveat to make things worse. I can no longer use my tablet to cast to my TV through Chromecast. Make sure to get Chromecast with Google TV (remote) to enable casting.",2024-02-05 02:49:18,3
"Love the download feature and the app in general, but I have a big issue with the app causing my UI to crash when I start a video on my Galaxy A14, which freezes my phone for several minutes.

Traveling trying to cast a video to the tv and it keeps prompting me to sign in or sign up. Other apps like hulu and max have not had any issues with this. Please add customization options. I do not like the new layout for the app. I am not interested in games from the app. I just want to watch a movie while on the go sometimes please make it easier or so I can customise the content I see in my account on the app.,2024-03-01 21:45:36,1
"I used to love Netflix. But now I can't ever watch it. Whether it's the phone app or even on TV, it either keeps showing the loading symbol, the play screen, or an error screen (on the TV). It's just a complete waste of money anymore, especially for the prices they charge🤦‍♀️",2024-04-05 02:23:33,1
"Higher the price, worse the service . Honestly, for the last few months, Netflix has been awful it kicks me out of the app for no reason, and also, when I press pause, it kicks me out . I've been thinking I need a refund for all these months because im not able to enjoy streaming, and it's very aggravating. So I'll be calling them soon for a refund at this point and will probably not pay for netflix again.",2024-04-01 00:37:23,1
"I have been using Netflix's long-time Go option for streaming. but now they are bad. I travel a lot, and I want to watch Netflix movies even when I'm traveling. Unfortunately, Netflix restricts the movies you can watch while traveling. My account is in the United States. Before, I didn't have these issues. Even if it wasn't working, I could use a VPN and still watch. Now, they deserve zero stars. We have eight accounts in our family, and I'm thinking of canceling if they don't fix the issue soon",2024-02-18 16:47:10,1
"Loved Netflix when it first came out. Now they are doing Net tricks. The cheapest plan has ads, which I don't mind. Now you can't watch a lot of movies or t.v shows because you don't have a regular plan. It's honestly getting worse, there's plenty of sites to watch these movies and t.v shows for free. I wouldn't recommend nextflix. Becareful of their Net tricks",2024-04-01 00:13:48,1
"The casting button has disappeared, I've restarted the phone and uninstalled/reinstalled the app and it's still not there. Edit- It appears that you now have to pay for the no-ad version to be granted the privilege of casting to a TV from your phone. I absolutely will not give a penny to Netflix for this. If it wasn't free with T mobile I would cancel completely. Way to ruin a good service ...",2024-02-06 02:46:04,1
"Due to Netflix changes to prevent password sharing, I legitimately cannot watch on my phone anymore without requesting temporary codes. My account is logged into both my TV and my phone. With the new ""household"" rule, all devices need to be connected to the same internet source to count as a household. My TV is hardwired and I use data on my phone. The building I live in has no wifi. Thanks for giving me my 13th reason why to cancel your service. Cheers!",2024-03-09 20:25:47,1
"Screw Netflix! Even though my Netflix account is paid for through my phone plan (as a perk of the family plan), they won't let everyone on the plan use the app. At first we could, but only on our phones (not on our TVs.).

Hulu, here I come!",2024-03-05 01:58:59,1
"Seriously done with this app. Why can't I have the simple option to disable the brightness adjustment feature on the app and keep the same settings as my phone while watching the shows? It is significantly brighter than the brightest setting on my phone already and even when I toggle the brightness bar all the way down, it's still too bright and I can't watch the show without it triggering a headache or worse. Some of us don't need to be staring at the sun on our screen! You can afford to fix it",2024-03-09 04:25:04,1
"Absurd that the brightness controls are still an issue after over 2 years. I DONT WANT THE APP TO CONTOL THE BRIGHTNESS AND PREVENT MY DEVICE FROM MAKING THE ADJUSTMENTS AUTOMATICALLY. Like seriously, please just remove the brightness adjustment bar from the app. It does not need to be there when it's readily available in your pull-down menu. Not to mention the limited download cache for offline, constant price hikes, and extra fees for additional family members. Think I'm done with Netflix.",2024-03-16 02:45:45,1
"So many years this was the place to go, great content and priced appropriately. Now, they, decided to add advertisements during streams, on a service we already pay for ad free content, hence the reason for a subscription payment. I have and can view the same content on a regular cable service that already has advertisements. ads and pop-ups before, fine, I get it, revenue is for the investors, but during? Really? Well, investors are seeing the share price drop consistently!!! VERY BAD CHOICE",2024-02-08 23:45:48,1
These changes are dumb. I only have Netflix because of my T-Mobile plan and honestly the way tmobile has been acting up lately I might leave and say goodbye to both services. Random titles on Netflix are restricted now with the ads plan? Tf? I can't even watch using the app on my laptop anymore. Their reasoning the app doesn't support the ads. Gtfoh! If hulu works just fine with ads how tf is it so tough for them to get it together. Don't bother asking cs for help they just tell you to upgrade.,2024-03-26 08:02:21,1
"Constantly have to turn the app off and back on just to get the subtitles to keep working. Plays like 1 or 2 episodes and then stops using subtitles even though it's set on subtitles. Go into settings to reset and get subtitles back on but it doesn't work. Have to restart the app every single time. Extremely annoying, I'll just go back to Hulu and Viki Rakuten. At least my money will go to apps that actually consistently provide the services I'm paying for. Pretty sure good ratings are fake.",2024-03-25 17:15:31,1

"Horrible app. Used to be able to cast, now Netflix, in a money grubbing attempt, has added advertisements to their content.

"I downloaded just to downrate ;) I pulled the app up on my TV and it didn't tell me at any point directly I was being charged, it said what my account service previously was, without an option to change anything, and immediately renewed service. It didn't say hey you're restarting your subscription like in the past it just automatically assumed because the app was open I was spending money. I confirmed no purchase.",2024-02-27 22:08:07,1
Can't cast from my phone when not on the add free subscription option. I've not seen any streaming service put such a dumb rule around the subscription that I use. I will definitely be un subscribing this month. Can't watch movies in bed on the chromecast but I could if it was a smart tv. This is pointless and I won't be paying an extra $10 for it.,2024-02-12 04:39:16,1
"Incompetence in software engineering. First of all there's no ability to view in portrait mode without third-party apps. When the app is in portrait mode the controls are a little worse, and it's lacking features in portrait and other modes.

"It's pretty basic. Expensive for what it offers, and has rules that make no sense. Netflix as an app and service used to be good, now the app has new updates because of the household rule. The problem is that the app will think a device isn't part of the household even if you're literally in the same house you've always used the app in and it's the same device. Also, the whole point of Netflix is to be able to watch on the go with ease. It's no longer easy to do so.",2024-03-19 01:57:54,1
App on any device constantly freezes and/or closes on its own randomly. Called support and got absolutely no help. The guy even stated from the get go that it was a known issue. None of his troubleshooting tactics worked. His tone really changed when I called him out that if this is a known issue then why am I paying full price for services I can't use. Ended up canceling our account all the other apps work just fine. Amazon and Hulu offer far better options and always works,2024-02-10 19:39:42,1
Another price hike coming in March. I've finally decided to cancel after a lackluster library that borderlines on shovelware. There are good shows and movies on Netflix that is true but it's not worth the price of admission anymore. The subscription prices keep going up and I'm questioning what the money is going towards. I don't care for any of the mobile games they decided to add in the app for some odd reason and I can't take another live action adaptation of a show I've already watched.,2024-02-29 17:29:34,1
"The app has been so glitchy since they started shoving commercials down our throats. The original content hasn't been good, and most of the content can be found on other streaming apps.

Get you act together Netflix, or I will ask T-Mobile to cancel all the subscriptions.",2024-02-19 12:36:09,1
"It's literally impossible to see dark scenes on an android tablet or phone. The app forces you to use their brightness slider, it locks the one for your general screen and it's highest brightness is WAY too dark. Can't see Avatar, can't see Stranger Things, etc. The requirement to use the App's brightness slider should be removed. My fiance has an iPad and doesn't have this issue, so it's clearly a problem with Netflix and Android.",2024-02-27 19:59:01,1
What's the point of putting on your/ your household phones if you have to jump through hoops Just to watch It on your phone. Netflix's recent password sharing has come at the expense of its customers and it's complete slimy greedy BS. The prices have gone up while the quality of what they have to show as drastically gone down over the years. I'm gonna demand a refund and never get Netflix again.,2024-03-26 13:22:50,1
"The app and the platform gets worse and worse. No more password sharing, awful short video things, and not to mention games. Yes exactly what I came here to do, play games instead of watch a show.

"The tudum sound (as if I'm opening the app) clangs during the middle of whatever I'm watching, sometimes multiple times in one session.

I chatted with the support team, and they said they would ""note my feedback"" but had no solution.",2024-02-23 05:14:09,2
"The fact netflix is blaming chromecast for THEIR issues is a fkn joke!. So recently, when I'm streaming netflix and using Chromecast, netflix keeps disconnecting from it.

Fix your bull 💩 coding",2024-03-24 04:35:15,2

"I don't often review apps, but I LOVE the audio-only feature!! Amazing. A great option for people who can't or don't like to watch and prefer to listen. Edit: this feature is gone and also Netflix can't seem to keep up with my Pixel 8 Pro; the image is very choppy.",2024-03-14 19:28:27,3
Recent update will not play anything without captions. These are not foreign titles. They play on my other devices without captions using the same profile. Turning captions off on this android device only works for the remainder of the current video. Captions return when playing the next video.

"Signed up for one movie, can't watch because of licensing I ditched my original plan because I was no longer able to let my daughter at college use the account, and she was the primary user. After a few months, a new release came out I wanted to watch, so I signed up for the ad plan. Go to watch the movie, and I'm blocked from watching it without upgrading my plan.

There is a bug that continues the movie or show you are watching when you put your phone in sleep if you don't close it or the app. I really want that to be fixed because I usually find my movie or show finished while my phone was in sleep. I then have to find the episode or spot I was at to continue from where I left off.",2024-03-15 19:21:45,3

Annoying update for Netflix makes it hard to watch your own Netflix when not watching at your house. Whatever happen to convinence. 🙄 Have to keep verifying and after ahwile it even forces you to stay on same wifi. So much hassle and for what anyone can just use a VPN to use same router ip to make it look like same network. Time to move to better apps.,2024-03-02 16:58:44,1
"Unusable. Netflix Households has made it so that I can't even watch Netflix on my own phone on my own account that I pay for, without sending myself a temporary code every time I open the damn app. Their attempt to crack down on password sharing has just made the entire app unusable trash.

I started Googling and it looks like I'm not the only one with this problem and that many people are canceling their service. That's the direction I'm headed.

Now you want to use wifi to verify my location before allowing me to watch the shows I pay for the ability to watch whenever I want? Plus, you made it look like I had to create a new account to move forward whatsoever. I had to look up what was going on separately, or this app would've just been a bad screensaver.

It doesn't even save the episode I'm on, let alone the part of the show I was on. This happens on the TV and the phone as well.

"I have always used Netflix as my go-to streaming option. This new update IS AWEFUL. Every single time I try to watch a show or movie, THE SUBTITLES ARE AUTOMATICALLY ON. No matter what I do with the settings. It is super annoying. When my profile is opened, it automatically goes to the ""new and hot"" page instead of my home page playing random trailers. And the amount of games that play annoying music while I'm trying to scroll through TV options is getting really old. Please fix it.",2024-02-02 15:01:15,2
Doesn't work on my PS4 and since they added this ad plan garbage nothing I want to watch is available and I can no longer use my chromecast. I only have it because it's free on my tmobile plan. I would never pay for such a greedy company and I do not recommend Netflix to anyone who would have to pay. The selection is weak at best past the 6 good shows they offer. I have a better variety on Tubi and they let me use my chromecast and it's free. Netflix is a major disappointment.,2024-03-13 20:46:17,1

I'm not sure if it's just my phone or what but I don't like the games feature on Netflix now and I have to constantly turn off the closed caption every single I want to watch a show regardless if I've turned it off the 1st time. The other issue is when it opens it takes you to some random page or some notification page instead of the home page. It all annoys me and I want to go back to just opening the app to the home page and continuing where I left off.,2024-01-31 00:57:38,2

Thing is, i didn't confirm, and still the subscription was restarted. Of course they provide no route for a refund. The only way to delete my card info is to put in another card. How is this legal?",2024-03-11 02:30:27,1
No problems streaming on my phone. No problems casting. No problems on my outdated Chromebook. Big problem streaming from my tv!

Now more limitations to users and multiple devices, range/far travel issues, limited options/features, lack of good content, way too many foreign films/shows no one cares for, lack of quality content, lack of seasons, and lack of quality movies (also stuff comes and goes). Honestly, don't bother paying for the higher end streaming.",2024-02-08 08:25:34,2
"Of course, they put out an update and don't double-check their work first. The latest update has somehow defaulted subtitles to be always on. Even when you go to settings and turn them off and apply your preferences, then try to watch something. Netflix removes your preferences & turns the subtitles back on again. The IT department needs to seriously double check their work before releasing an update. Any idiot can work in IT. Apparently not this netflix department.

It used to be an easy to use, affordable app, but it gets not only more expensive but more and more annoying because of the frequent email checks and limits. Wasn't using the app for a few weeks and now that I decided to watch a movie, it keeps telling me my network is not working (but guess what, it is), therefore I am just paying and not even able to watch anymore from my phone.

"Ever wanted to watch a loading screen after skipping 10 seconds. This is the simulator for it. It isn't the core product but this is what it's best at. Pretending to load and pretending to work. If you skip just once too often ahead or back it will pretend to load for eternity without progress, regardless of your connection. I even tested that myself while at going to a friend. Anyways. Don't get this unless you like fake loading screens and if you simply hate yourself.",2024-04-22 15:03:52,1

HDR support on my phone and on Netfix makes things look better, has everything you really need to do when watching Netflix on the run, watching Netflix on a tablet, or maybe you enjoy watching on your phone even at home.

I've been a member of Netflix for a good few years now and have never had a problem I watch Netflix on my Amazon fire stick and my smart TV with no issues I did recently cancel my Netflix subscription and tried another streaming service due to the recent price change but returned after a month as it just wasn't as good as Netflix. For me there is always something good to watch on Netflix.,2024-02-19 08:49:43,5
"TRASH household policy. I mainly watch netflix on my phone using unlimited data, and Netflix has decided to lock me out of my account simply because I don't log in often enough to my home wifi.

All the security hoops you have to jump through make this app a joke. I can't sign in on my phone or laptop when travelling. I keep getting bs unhelpful 'help' screens when I sign in preventing me from actually opening the app. Netflix is just bad and I can't wait for it to go under so all the other streaming services can buy rights to all the (poorly made) Netflix content. Also their support is terrible. After waiting 10 min for an employee to answer I got disconnected after 1 minute.,2024-02-25 20:04:53,1

If I can't cast it then I'm just going to cancel it. The whole point of the app was that I could just cast it and watch it anywhere without needing to buy something Device to plug into a t.v that's not a smart t.v with apps.

I am disappointed because I believe you are capablle of making the experience great and enjoyable, which should be the main aim of paying for subscription.

"It has been over a 1½years that I have been dealing with this issue. Simply put, every so often, the Netflix app decides that my phone (Samsung S22 Ultra EXYNOS) no longer supports Widevine L1 and reverts to L3, which limits my video playback to SD at a horrible bitrate despite having a 4K plan. They have known about this for well over a year with this phone and they have had plenty of time to fix it.

What the hell. I cancelled Netflix because the cost was getting ridiculous for the few shows I still used it for. But I decided to give it another go only to find that there's not a cast button for some reason!!

"Can't log in since the new update!!! Having issues with the tv and mobile phone version of the app. Is saying ""Can't find network connection"" my network is fine all other streaming platforms are working perfectly no network issues. When i call to resolve the issue the call center agent says i should check with my service provider even though i explained that my network is good and everything else is working they insist that there is nothing they can do. Maybe i should cancel my subscription!",2024-03-18 09:26:38,1
"If I could give zero stars I would. My family uses one netflix account that my sibling pays for, but they're temporarily abroad and now we are unable to access netflix on our devices. I dont understand if they are paying for a service for 3 other people to use, why we cannot use it. I can't imagine how annoying it'd be if I had to deal with this when I was still on base in the military. Netflix is what I had during free time. This isnt even ""password sharing"". We are the same household!! Trash.",2024-02-28 19:52:23,1

I've been using Amazon Prime for the last few weeks, no problem with that at all. I may just cancel my Netflix subscription!",2024-04-09 22:16:42,1
Netflix is pretty mediocre except for the anime selection recently. But one problem that I've seen is that you keep removing Classic Movies and Shows for additional Big Mouth seasons. Also you removed the best feature of Netflix which was to share an account with other people.,2024-04-02 23:49:55,1
"I'm deleting my premium subscription. how DARE you limit my devices? I'm not able to sign in on my phone to the ACCOUNT I PAY FOR?

I hope u get the blockbuster treatment.",2024-04-16 22:47:49,1
"Since they implemented the household rule, the subscription is just pointless and too greedy. Our family payed premium but now I can't access it. Didn't want the inconvenience of being an extreme member and added fee for a subscription that we mostly access on our TV. Mobile plan as alternative is also pointless because quality sucks by a lot. Disney plus made more sense for me to keep than this service with its mostly limited content. So yeah, thanks a lot Netflix.",2024-03-18 23:09:26,1

I regret downloading the app with my data and even subscribing too. I feel cheated by Netflix.",2024-02-24 06:33:38,1
"Netflix is good but I notice I'm using it increasingly less and less. There is no IMDB integration, which I've always found frustrating, and probably because IMDB has been absorbed into the amazon universe. The search function is frustrating e.g. when I search under comedy I'm offered lots of films and programmes to trawl through that are definitely NOT comedy! And I can level this criticism accross all genre in search. I end up exasperated trying to get programmes that I want to watch!",2024-02-11 06:55:06,3
Casting only to the device that have your Netflix. It's absolutely pointless that to use casting option from your mobile you have to install and sign in to the account on TV. What's the point of that??? If can play movie on TV using Netflix why would o cast it? It's not very smart.,2024-04-07 18:51:39,1

One of the best features about Netflix was it allows the users to watch shows/movies while on voice calls but after the update that feature is gone. It will be an absolute pleasure if Netflix bring back that feature. I really hope they will fix it.,2024-04-02 07:46:10,3

Most of the time the series is only having the half of the season either from the start to the middle or from middle to some extent.....

"My account got hacked and the person added services I didn't want. When I called them to remove the charges, they wouldn't honor the price of my basic plan (Initially $7.99, now $9.99-which was grandfathered) and said I have to pay the new price of the 'Standard package' $16.49-double what I was originally paying for my inital plan price when it was $7.99). So because I was hacked I have to pay nearly two times as much. Customer support was unhelpful, so I canceled altogether.",2024-02-14 16:12:12,1

Wow what happened to good movies. 9 out of ten things on Netflix isn't even worth watching anymore. And tor the rest wow played out I can only watch role models so many times. Think I've watched it 8 times the last few years and I own it on DVD. There just isn't anything good to watch. Most of the Netflix movies are like a 4th grader wrote and directed them with juice box and nap breaks.

Forcing people to pay 20+ a month to be able to cast.I had Netflix for years and it's only gotten worse over time.

"For streaming to chromecast it works better than the SmartTV built in apps, if you can ignore the plague of mobile games that are constantly being pushed. Changing the volume for casting unmutes the sample videos. Once connected to casting, the app shouldn't unmute unless I explicitly hit the unmute icon. For English parts the English captioning is fine but once another language is spoken will often say ""speaks other language"" instead of the translation even for clearly critical scenes.",2024-03-17 01:00:45,3

"just when Netflix finally added interesting shows and movies, the household system ruined my experience! I'm sorry for not being able to afford an account for myself alone and having to share one with my family who lives away from me. just for the sake of money, you implemented this new system but I'd rather go to another streaming site that does allow sharing between different households. money hunger is the worst!",2024-04-25 03:41:53,1
"If I could give this zero, I would do so gladly. What is this new Netflix household nonsense? Why would you automatically activate a service that the customer does not tell you to? I have been blocked from using the Netflix account of my family. I have been signed out of my Netflix account forcefully. How can you make a rule that one must connect to a specific WiFi to use ones Netflix account. I have patiently overlooked things Netflix has done but this is crossing the line. This is shameful.",2024-02-16 17:17:50,1
Didn't expect to enjoy the games but I like the selection so far. Good content selection and Originals but a far cry from what is available in the states. Which doesn't justify the cost in India especially after removing the password sharing feature. 5 stars when you make the pricing strategy more consumer friendly.,2024-03-16 07:06:14,3
"On Chrome OS, you cannot have this in a small window while doing work as it takes up the whole screen which if you're trying to do work while catching up with a TV series you best be having to a dual monitor setup. Other services do have this capability of being a small window. I don't understand why Netflix hasn't enabled this.",2024-02-15 16:35:42,3
"Price gouging for mediocre content. It's been a long relationship, but I think we are done. The cost isn't worth it. Then, charging more for using devices not connected to my wifi? It's my account. I pay for it, I want to use it when I want, where I want, with who I want. Now the app crashes 8/10 times no matter which device I'm streaming from. The only thing that kept me using Netflix was the witcher and after this season nobody will be watching. Sad.",2024-02-18 14:41:00,1
Have been using Netflix for a while now there's an issue where it says not part of a Netflix household and I don't understand why when all devices are connected to the same network. My account isn't connected to any TV because we don't have a smart TV so how do I register a household. This update is absolutely flawed and stupid,2024-03-18 16:53:43,1
"Over it. They cancel their shows after one season, constantly. Not worth getting into any of their tv shows. Why even bother? The worst part, they cancel shows with good ratings, being in the top for over 10 weeks. Shows that do get a next season, take years to make it. So over it. Seriously!! Also, their pricing has gotten outrageous. Amazon and Hulu are better by far. I'm switching Netflix to Apple to see and so far I'm loving Apple TV. They keep their shows and they are AWESOME! BYE NETFLIX!",2024-03-31 06:59:59,1

"Good app, nothing really to complain about, but one thing I wish Netflix should do is be able to see EVERY single shows/movies you have watched. The history selection we have currently is limited, and I think it would be amazing if we got an end of the year wrap or something. At least being able to view all the shows I have watched is enough.",2024-02-18 01:18:49,5
"Dear Netflix it's been 2 years that I've been using ur apps, it's a lot of help bcuz my bonds with my family and friends while watching on Netflix grew by laughing cause we liked comedies🤣 and some other genres, but can you please post the series called "" The walking dead "" it's an amazing series and good to watch with family on weekends, sadly we can't bcuz it's not on Netflix.

Thank you I guess.",2024-04-11 18:34:29,1
Netflix is great but I think it's annoying and unfair how you can have like 5 accounts but only have 2 people watching at a time it's really annoying and also sometimes it won't save were I am on a episode or even sometimes it will take me to a whole other episode if I'm rewatching a series it's super annoying but yeah other than that it's fine,2024-02-17 20:30:28,3
Terrible experience all around. Awful original content. Worse than Amazon. No Chromecast support with ad supported tier. I guess when they raise the prices for no reason they need some way to convince people to pay the extra after they already had support before. I can't even be bothered to watch and I can't cancel as I'm getting it for free from my carrier. Will never launch the app again due to terrible decisions by this company. Maybe Disney will buy them and rid us of their brainlessness.,2024-03-10 00:34:02,1

"It's a great app with many movies and series and great quality. There is one problem I have with it though and that is that netflix removes some movies or series and without a reason (?) I find it very frustrating, same thing is that they publish for example part 4 of some movie and not the other parts. I think they should be more active with uploading new parts of series (especially anime) and uploading all parts of movies.",2024-02-12 07:29:35,3

Netflix is so willing to add random people as additional members. Yet when my mom who lives at the same address goes to work she's a complete stranger. Yet they won't correct the overcharge. They didn't even validate with me to add the additional member. If this goes any further I'm done. They need to fire whoever came up with this plan.

The app changed Language language to Arabic. Took 3 goes to get it changed back to English. The support desk were useless.

The fact that the Netflix is my account that I pay for. I get a message on my mobile devices that it's not part of the household and it's my account that I pay for. Netflix needs to fix this ASAP.

"Netflix was great... Until they started charging more THEN not allowing password sharing. Everything is expensive as it is. If a family wants to share their Netflix so we can all try to save a few little bucks for our next meal, then they should be allowed.

Just got a pop up saying that because I'm not on my home wifi I will have to use temporary codes to watch anything or sign up for another account just for my phone. The website says the same. This is the dumbest way to drum up more subscribers.

Content has gotten so stale compared to the other streaming services. It used to be by far the best a few years back but now it seems like they're just pumping out cheap rom coms and low budget docuseries. I wish they would focus on the streaming aspect and leave production to more qualified teams that create higher budget productions. Quality over quantity is always best and im getting tired of a ton of average at best content on this app. Do better Netflix we know you can! Also price is high,2024-03-10 03:02:16,2
"Worst streaming service. Not only is the price getting outrageous , it is constantly powering off/crashing on all devices (phone, TV, computer). It's trash. They've taken off most of the good shows and movies. It's not worth your money!",2024-02-11 06:48:40,1

Netflix is a pile of junk. They have a very limited amount of actual good things to watch and have the option for people to share an account but you have to live with the person who owns the account which what difference does it make if you live with them or not. In a time where people are financially struggling what does Netflix decide to do? Make it so everyone has to have their own account and can't share a simple pleasure. Delete the account and never using them again.,2024-02-25 22:34:11,1
"The content on this platform is getting worse, I see more low budget, dubbed, quickly put together, badly written rubbish every time I turn on the app, I find my self watching more and more of other platforms and less and less nf.

"Cancelled bc they removed the sharing option that they used in the beginning to create customers. Now they've turned away from what got them there. I won't put food on your table now. I hope many more will join me. It's not that important, but it's the principle of the matter. Get back to appreciating long term customers. Hope the losses hurt. Also this is now bloatware on Samsung. If I wanted it, I would install it. This is my device and if it isn't then make it free. Period.",2024-03-20 20:47:15,1

Cheating app. They don't give a proper dos and don'ts and when asked they close very smartly saying you will get a refund in 30 days you pay again. Very irresponsible answer from their end.

too many barriers and issues within my own household on the same WI-FI etc Went to watch on my phone and was notified I was limited to a 14 day period!! What??? The cost/price continues to climb despite the fact that I have been with the company since it began in 1997! No loyalty or customer appreciation! It was better when I was in the military across the world! Now experiencing issues increasingly. I have maintained the same profiles for myself and my household for years. Now issues??,2024-03-16 05:26:21,2
"Netflix was a five star until the household implementation now I can't watch shows in my own home, this will cost you many subscribers, and viewers. The price may be $7 but that should have been enough to make an app that can be widespread through family in different houses. Horrible ui too, why on my phone when I go to see what's new i can't see everything and then it's hard to tell when it ends. Netflix is a multi million dollar company it can afford for people to share accounts.",2024-02-05 07:47:43,1
"This new ""one household "" thing is awful. Every time I leave the house, I have to resign on. We are in the same household, but the ""owner"" is on a long flight right now, so I can't sign into my own account 😑 I get why they implemented this but ffs make a better system. I think we are going to cancel the subscription this is so frustrating",2024-03-06 18:17:03,2
"Worked great for a whole, now it doesn't work at all. I updated, which usually ruins the app, it still doesn't work. What did you do to it? At least let us know if you canceled the app, so we can Uninstall it and make room on our phone. Bad form.",2024-02-08 14:28:19,1
"Netflix's ""household account"" system is awful. Their content is awful too. They waste money making new shows and all the good ones get canceled after one season. They're hungry for your money now because they spent all the money they made on awful content. They're going down. My family is canceling our subscription until we're all allowed to watch again. We don't all live together but we share one account. There's no reason netflix needs five accounts out of us. None whatsoever, pure greed. 👌",2024-03-24 06:04:20,1
"Just recently, subtitles keep defaulting to on. Every episode. Have to manually switch them off, then next episode they are back on. Hugely annoying and unnecessary. Android, Pixel 7.",2024-02-10 14:08:53,4
"Hi, why is my Netflix telling me my password is wrong? I have already reset the password once because it was telling me it was wrong, then when resetting tried the old password but it said, of course, I couldn't use an old password. Now it's doing it again. I don't want to change my password again, any solution?",2024-02-19 11:07:18,3

"Using a mobile device to watch Netflix on a TV isn't available on an ad-supported plan. To use your mobile device to watch Netflix on your TV, you'll need to change to an ad-free plan.

I will never treat your crew with respect.",2024-03-01 22:06:47,1

The app is really bad in that when you're trying to scroll it starts to auto play everything. I've set it to turn off autoplay for the profiles but it doesn't seem to care.,2024-02-24 22:55:57,1
Netflix was good at a time but it is long passed. Since they changed their policy my account has been hacked countless times. The client support is utter BS they just copy paste one message telling me to contact my bank. Sadly I can't give them 0 stars,2024-02-24 09:48:52,1
"I downloaded this app when I signed up to Netflix in January. Throughout January I just got the message ""something went wrong"" whenever I tried to use it. Now, the app won't even load. Save your money and pay for something that works, like Prime or Sky",2024-02-25 19:08:14,1

Haven't been able to open app in 2 weeks! Error code and loads on TV but only for a few minutes before you get kicked off. Way too many other streaming options to pay for this. Do better,2024-03-18 21:19:01,1
Movie and TV show selection has degraded so badly over the last few years. When they do have something good they take it off for no apparent reason saw a commercial for a movie on Netflix tried to watch it a few days later to find it's not there. Used to watch several shows on there that are gone like seriously the stock holders should sue for this company intentionally damaging it's value there no other explanation other than intentional degradation you can't be that stupid.,2024-02-27 03:48:33,1
"It's completely Amazing. I love the app and I always binge watch in there. But I wish that Netflix had an option where two or more people could watch together and interact at the same time. You know, like, I and my friend are watching the same show at the same time! As if I invite her to watch it with me and then we can chat/talk while watching it would be amazing update and whole new experience for everyone out there! I'm sure you guys will kill it if there was such an option.❤️,🖤..........",2024-03-24 15:07:56,5

"Why is it being dumb? Like I'm paying for a service but because I travel (am military) it's now giving me issues when I had never had them before? Like I'm tempted on suspending my subscription for these ridiculous issues. I don't want a temporary fix because I will always be traveling due to my job. Like I'll be in a different country come next month, am I going to have this issue continue on?",2024-03-17 02:34:44,1
So many web series and movies are available on this platform & all are best. But Using Netflix in windows laptop I face a problem on app & website. sometimes I watching on Netflix sometimes video paused and message shown error occurred.,2024-02-25 12:45:00,4

"restriction over household coverage WiFi is so bad, it needs to go. Now I can't watch from my phone when I'm outside of the house. They do release an option where you need to confirm your status by sending the code through email, but only valid for 2 weeks and then if you happen to watch a show outside of your house on another device using different WiFi coverage, you need to do the process all over again. Quit bleeding yourself, make it make sense. I can see why more & more people switch sides",2024-02-18 16:39:17,1
"Canceled service. Forced to get temp code for Samsung phone, when I literally just got done watching upstairs on apple tv, on the same wifi.

I am a single Mom of two who I share custody with. We can not stream on our TV anymore unless we pay more. We have been loyal customers for years. I can't afford a smart TV or afford to pay more for my Netflix plan. I used to love Netflix. The only reason I'm keeping it around is for my kids. Netflix has become money hungry. It's ridiculous.,2024-02-07 20:13:25,1

"I pay extra for a family account, I shouldn't have to set it up every 2 weeks because you want to have all the money in the world. Ending my subscription and moving on, will pirate from now on and not give any of these streaming apps another penny so until they stop being money hungry and penalizing customers whilst giving a worse service as time goes on then they can suck a fat one. The app is also the only app that refuses to connect to Chromecast so done me a favour thanks guys",2024-02-28 16:55:55,1
Really hate netflix now. I subs premium plan for years and there's no extra charge if i use more than 1 tv. Now 2024 i need to add rm13 more to use on other tv. So now this plan can only use 1 tv + 5 other devices. What a capitalism. I sub for PREMIUM PLAN !! NOT BUDGET OR MID PLAN. Just give all laa. Its up to me if i want to use on 2 or 3 tvs bcs i paid ! Extra charge for what ??!! Im moving to disney soon. Bye netflix loser,2024-04-09 06:42:23,1
"Netflix was good at the start but I can no longer recommend this app to use. Most of their originals are no longer imperative to today's society, and their documentaries are not accurate historically I'd rather just stay subbed to the history Channel Vault on prime. Now especially with how you can no longer share the app it is not worth it to get a subscription with their service. I would recommend to look elsewhere.",2024-03-26 12:13:41,2
"Making us watch ads for a service we're already paying for and HAVE to pay for in order to even use the service is absolutely ridiculous. At this point, Netflix should just be free because what are we paying for? We pay for a service just for there to be ads and now we have to pay MORE just to get rid of them. The prices went up, the whole password sharing issue, and now THIS. This is nothing but a greedy money hungry move to get more money made without considering us users",2024-02-18 18:06:24,1

"My mother paid extra for additional people to be able to stream and yet because we don't live together they decided to boot me and my other two family members over the past few months. I share my Max subscription with her without any issue, Netflix is annoying and greedy. She's cancelled and now we share Hulu. Hopefully they learn to allow sharing, limit accounts and devices per account which is reasonable, otherwise I've pretty much caught up on the originals and am not going to sign up soon.",2024-02-27 01:28:43,1
Casting is not working today. Starts Netflix on Chromecast but never plays an episode. It also starts the app on the Chromecast without being told to. Plus Netflix are becoming a super greedy company. Sorry out your software before gouging us.,2024-02-19 05:54:13,1
"Terrible app and services. They've implemented that stupid main account policy which is extremely inconvenient for my family, since I have kids that are out of state in different colleges. Look elsewhere if you want to a streaming account for you and your family. Not to mention the prices they charge are absurd! It really isn't worth it. Just a matter of time before they become the next blockbuster.",2024-03-14 23:52:08,1

Not part of this household. I prefer a family account to have multiple users and every time me or one of my family members tries to watch at work for while traveling it sends an email to the main account holder and then we have to get a hold of them on their cell phone in order to log into Netflix which is sometimes late at night or when the other one is not available. This kind of defeats the purpose of a multi-person family account.,2024-02-28 13:48:05,1
"The only thing I hate about Netflix is that whenever I watched a new anime they're 3rd, 4th, 5th and other season gets removed, like, take one piece as an example!

so far I have returned to this app after a breaf hiatus. I left due to the raising prices that they couldn't justify. some of the new material is binge worthy and drew me back (temporarily) but so far the newer shows' dialog is rather clunky and the acting is meh. you need to find someone that is passionate about writing and not in it for the paycheck. some of this is quite cringe worthy. just saying.

There seems to be a glitch where the app asks to enter the pin after every episode amd the substitles dissapear. It's been more than a year since I've had this problem.,2024-03-08 16:20:28,3
Adding games to all subscriptions was a poor decision as it most likely impacts the pricing for all of us who just want to stream. Honestly though the lack of actual good programs on Netflix really doesn't justify their price. Netflix originals are very hit or miss with most dropping off after the first or second seaon. Amazon and apple tv seem to be producing more popular and overall better shows for their users at a much lesser price,2024-01-24 17:46:35,2

Neither I or my son has set up a netflix household and now I have to have temporary access to an account that I pay for.

Horrible with the household change. I bounce back and forth between my parents and I don't want to have to bug my mom everytime I am logging in to a different device. It's idiotic. My mom has gotten to the point where she's so close to canceling the subscription bc she's tired of having to go into her email or whatever to get the code so I can type it in. And since she doesn't really watch it and it's really more for me she is fine canceling. Others have ads but at least I am not bugging my mom.,2024-01-31 02:59:02,1

"The overall experience was good, but what's the point of showing the title name in search if the show is not available and showing recommendations to other similar shows when we search a show? Also one more thing I'm annoyed is when we adjust the brightness in the app itself while viewing an movie/episode, it won't readjust to auto. We have to uninstall the app to make the app work with auto brightness again. This is annoying and it works as expected in iOS version of the app. Kindly fix this.",2023-12-21 05:21:51,4

"I now receive the standard package for free with t mobile. Unless I am remembering incorrectly, I could have sworn, I read that it would allow 2 TV's to be watching Netflix simultaneously.

"It isn't bad nor good. With my experience, the app works completely fine, but I do have some issues with it. The big point is the increase of pricing and the discontinuing of shows.

My problem is that when I sign in, it says ""you're almost there, few more steps to watch"" and they say we sent the email to my account but I don't know what I will do, I see in my email app and then: nothing is sent. The Netflix app lied to me please I want to watch. :(",2023-12-14 18:12:23,1

Worst streaming app ever. Every time I search for a movie or series it just says that it isn't available. What's the use of paying so much if there's so little worth watching and those small amount of good movies/series just disappear too or get cancelled. I'm tired of watching the same good shows again and again...,2023-12-08 05:16:04,1
Was having an excellent experience of using Netflix until they introduced netflix household. Now I can't even watch on my multiple devices because of this. Keep prompting for temporary watching.

The choice of content is much wider as compared to other OTT platforms. The user interface is easy to understand and navigate. They need to improve their search results category because it is difficult to find most of the searched titles easily.,2024-01-05 15:11:03,4

As we all know Netflix is used for most people to binge things over and over again. You need to put something on there to clear out the watch history so we can start over and keep track. Once you watch something once the red line is across it forever there is no way to erase the watch history. That would be cool,2024-01-01 00:54:52,4

Been a customer of this service for 10 years now but it's time for me to leave. $25 a month for subpar choices in shows just doesn't sit well with me. What used to be a trustworthy streaming service has really fell off and continues to rise prices. The only reason I gave it more than 1 ⭐ is because I did use to like it in its hay day. $10-15 content for almost double what it's worth is crazy.,2024-01-20 14:13:23,2

"The app is fine, but the service is going downhill fast. The pricing is now ridiculous, especially because they are notorious for canceling highly rated shows that we invest our time into without a proper conclusion. 4k streaming should be standard, not a pay wall.

Left hand doesn't know what the right is doing. Canceled membership then company tries to draw payment after membership has been canceled and they say I have access until 1/14/24. So the billing department puts account on hold because of lack of critical thinking skills. Maybe you should credit me back since company email says I have access to said date above.,2023-12-14 17:45:30,1

Loved it. Till I didn't. Recently moved out and now netflix won't let me use my account I share with my others as I'm not apart of the household. It's absolute garbage when a company expects you to pay double just because of a changed location. Terrible on them for not backing a customer when this money will end up in another rich man's pocket...,2024-01-29 21:42:31,1
It says that my mobile phone isnt part of my household when I have been using it to watch most of the time even in my own house! And its MY OWN ACCOUNT! Getting more ridiculous each time Netflix! Get it fixed!!,2024-02-01 17:48:17,1
Netflix took off 20 euro from my account for a ultra member ship. Something i never signed up for! Disgracefull! Also you dont pay for a month but 2 days before ur subscripton ends they cut you off..also revomendations ate 0% accurate with things i dont like. NETFLIX IS kEXTREMELY BORING AND EXPENSIVE. NOT WORTH ANY MONEY! PLEASE REFUND MY MONEY!,2024-01-31 04:30:12,1

For whatever reason Netflix is not able to download or showcase on 5G or 4G networks.....it's redundant and obtuse in this day and age......For some I can't download the app....my phone is not fully stored...I don't have a out of date phone A15.....and it on a 5G network and Still can't not download....I am going to see if this continues today....then I will cancel subscription,2024-02-20 11:17:58,1

As another person put its a shadow of its former self with the recent household restrictions it also restricts traveling streamer... there isn't as much good content as frequently as there used to be and with all this they are talking about raising prices again frankly unless they plan on allowing 2 or so households or unlimited use in travel with the price increase I think everyone should look to using a different service that doesn't do those restrictions or just get cable,2024-02-28 18:17:35,1
"i used to love this app so much, i've used it for several years. with the recent updates i can't watch from my own account because i made it while i was living with my parents, so the option is to either pay double or cut *them* off of the account? nope bye let us delete the app nobody wants this",2024-01-30 12:09:28,1

I'm so disappointed with the new household thingy. You all should remember that the main people who use this application are students away from their parents/household. This is not it.

I feel penalised for having a decent TV with just the most expensive package as the only option to watch 4k etc. Especially with the recent price rise to £18pm!!!

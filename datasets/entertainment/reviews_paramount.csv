"The app is just packed with bugs. Wrong titles, every time you continue watching a show the main page starts at season one, when you start watching something from where you stopped it's never the same place, or it starts all over. I have to select the profile every time I open the app, if I click on the title nothing happens, looks like the thing was put together in a week, in the dark.",2024-04-17 17:51:37,1
"Some downloaded videos won't play, for example I downloaded Billions and Mayor of Kingstown and neither will play. I tried restarting my device, force closing the app, even trying to play the downloaded videos while connected to the internet wouldn't work. I am able to watch other shows when offline, it just seems to randomly decide I can't watch certain shows.",2024-04-21 19:08:13,3
"Subtitles are important. Some jump or blink in and out, are empty, double for a language (and both empty) or missing in English for some episodes. Plus a couple other bugs like the system controls only blending out by double tapping at the start of playback at the right time. Also, I'm pretty sure some downloads just disappeared.",2024-04-24 20:17:48,1
"I've been unable to watch anything for the last 3 days. I keep getting error code ""6000"", I have uninstalled and re-installed the app, as well as disconnected and reconnected the Wi Fi on the TV. This is happening across all devices, phone, lap top and TV. I have created a case with support also. I would like to think I will be credited for this down time, seems unfair to pay for something I am unable to use.",2024-04-22 07:10:05,1
"Quite glitchy and does not always remember where you are up to in an episode. Likewise, when switching between devices between rooms for example, it does not always register where you watched up to on the other device. If you download an episode, it never registers what you have watched even if you open up the app in WiFi, it does not seem to join up the dots Not nearly as slick as competitors like netflix but ok",2024-04-17 10:35:32,3
"Although the shows on here are good, there are quite a few problems. Often, it won't remember where I am on a show, so I will click on episode 26, and it will start playing episode 15. The download feature on this app also doesn't really work, so it sometimes says ""you have no downloads"" or it will still require wifi/4g to play the episode which defeats the whole point of a download",2024-04-25 06:59:34,2
"Pro tip- If you're going to sign up for this, sign up through Amazon Prime, so when you decide to cancel it, you can just stop paying for the channel. I signed up through their website and I'm done with the subscription, but I'm just getting the runaround with trying to cancel it. I'm sure they try to make this as confusing and inconvenient as possible so that you give up and they can keep taking your money. Worst customer service ever.",2024-04-21 13:39:42,1
About the worst streaming app on here. Constantly loses connection giving an error. Often gets stuck in the optimizing playback mode. The ui is pretty horrible too having to scroll through their recommend shows to get down to the continue watching section. Honestly I have the app for Star Trek lower decks but once that's canceled I'll be deleting this app and won't ever look back,2024-04-16 23:34:09,1
"Honestly, considering what's happening with all of the streaming services right now, Paramount+ isn't bad. That being said, the app does not allow you to send feedback as in the feedback button is broken. And given that this is a major streaming service, there should be more audio description for shows, as well as more options for subtitle controls. I don't want a giant black box behind my subtitles. It ruins the show.",2024-04-08 00:59:27,3
GLITCHY! Tonnes of great content here but once in a while it just will not open and I need to uninstall and reinstall the app. Update! Paramount reached out and was great. Turns out the problem was the USB stick I use on my TV. Other apps were not using the extra storage so I mistakenly assumed it was an issue with the Paramount app. Great app but one complaint. Never thought I'd say this but rewind and fast forward are difficult to navigate.,2024-04-14 00:39:18,4
"App/streaming service is alright for the most part. A few issues that I've found: -On the phone app it will scroll up randomly, not very smooth scrolling either -Autoplay setting is the absolute worst. It will play episodes in order like it should, but if you're at the end of a movie or a series, it gives you a 15 second countdown to either start the series at episode 1 or just play some completely random movie. -fast forward or rewind on chromecast almost never shows the correct preview scene",2024-04-14 16:27:01,1
"By far the worst streaming app on LG TV and on android. Recent issue, it won't open without online connection to access my offline downloads, then it says the episodes I downloaded and watched last Thursday in offline mode, are not there today Monday. It says I don't have any downloads. Generally speaking, shows are badly prepared for streaming. Many of them won't allow to skip intro, skip recap etc. Needs to be done all manually.",2024-04-08 13:23:01,2
It's great when it works. I love the movies and shows on the platform and it is very easy to navigate. U fortunately sometimes it has to buffer which gets annoying. I have otjer streaming services and they do not have this problem. Also I have flat mates who have their own profiles and they cam go in and change things. It would be n8ce as the actual account holder to have an administrator profile like all the other sites . Also when binging you have to cluck on the full screen at the beginning.,2024-04-13 21:23:37,3
"This app is a joke. Constant errors. When using it on Google TV it can't handle opening a show or movie from Google Search. This issues is the most frustrating, if you are wanting to re-watch an episode, let's say you last stopped watching it with less than 50 seconds left, there is no restart from the beginning function. You have to watch the remainder, go to the next episode then go back. Waste of time. No idea if the developers or product manager read this but, just copy what the apps do.",2024-04-13 11:40:48,1
"Was forced to update to the latest version for the app to launch. After doing so, tried to watch the live football, and get the white loading hoop for about 30 seconds, at which point it goes to the home screen instead of showing the football. If I choose 'live tv' on the home menu, it immediately goes to the live stream American news which works fine, so I know it is not my phone that is the issue. Support guide has zero useful help. Grrrr, I infuriating!",2024-04-03 11:13:46,1
"Unsubscribing from Paramount proved to be a frustrating experience. The process was unnecessarily complex, requiring the same mobile device and browser used for subscribing. After attempting multiple browsers and devices for an hour, I finally managed to unsubscribe. As the account owner, I expected a smoother process, and I am disappointed",2024-04-25 13:42:09,1
The range available to stream is good and constantly improving. The app itself is an utter mess with consistent issues that they show no interest in correcting. After installing the app to firestick it consistently needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled to work. Eventually it stuck on a downloading loop and can't be opened or deleted. I can still watch on phone. A quick Google search shows this to be a common issue. It also seems to be effectively impossible to cancel subscription.,2024-03-05 04:20:47,2
"As the app was actively asking for my feedback, I'm happy to provide it. Streaming is working fine, no issues there. But the App is just not storing or showing the progress on the movies or shows I'm watching, so I always have to figure out where I left off. If I haven't had a coupon for a free year I would have already canceled my subscription.",2024-02-28 11:48:36,1
"Good content.... However the app itself seems to be a little buggy! It is inconsistent with it's downloads and if it does, then shows error messages when trying to play them back, some episodes I have watched seem to be stuck on the ""continue watching"" section and there doesn't appear to be any function on the app to mark the extent of episodes or films viewed which leaves me to note the time when I stop watching and have to scroll forward to where I left off.",2024-03-07 22:15:33,2
"The content is great for sci-fi fans. That's a big thumbs up from me. The interface has a few minor issues. The selection screen seems to reload every 10 seconds or so. Also zooming the screen won't go bigger than the camera hole, which is annoying, my device has a hole in the screen for a camera, it won't zoom over that. It should be my choice, it's my device after all. Also the android navigation buttons do appear over the zoomed screen. Again, it's annoying. I hope devs will fix the issues.",2024-03-02 20:26:50,4
"When the app works, it's great. Unfortunately regularly have errors. Sometimes when you pause it the audio and visual are out of sync. Or the visual is frozen where you paused it. The worst issue is when it comes up with a 6000 error. After googling the only option is to uninstall and reinstall. While this has previously worked. It isn't anymore.",2024-03-23 10:18:59,3
"I downloaded the max amount of shows, didn't get round to watching them so they expired and deleted themselves. That part is fine. But now I can't download anything else because it thinks it's full. Can't stress enough that the downloads section is entirely empty. Up until the recent update this error message effectively crashed the app as there was no way to close it. They have added an ""ok"" to close but that's all the progress made. No space for all the other issues but they are legion.",2024-03-09 15:10:29,1
"It's criminal that you charge people for this app. The content is great but the app on my tv is completely unusable probably 40% of the time. Stutters and never plays, crashes 100% of the time while trying to watch the last two episodes of a season I was watching, audio out of sync, the list goes on. You obviously know this. There's so many people complaining about it and you do nothing about it.",2024-03-05 10:39:11,1
"Very poor performance when attempting to view sports broadcasts. There's no option to view in time lapse if I miss the start of a game. Then, when the game is over, the highlights aren't available until hours later. Very poor compared with many other of my subscriptions. I'm done with uninstalling and reinstalling the app. on my devices and TV and I've cancelled my subscription.",2024-03-17 22:45:36,1
"So far so horrible. I recently signed up for the trial and 5 minutes in ,I'm about ready to cancel already. I get an invalid response error if trying to watch something on a browser from my phone, I'm also unable to go back to a ""continue watching"" feature which allows the end user to continue where he or she left off. The content has the potential to be good although I feel it's still buggy and needs some work. I'll try it on PC and TV and see what it looks like, otherwise im out.",2024-03-14 14:44:18,1
Selection- once you're through a few good properties there's not much left. Mostly B movies/shows. The app itself is glitchy. Constantly blacks out for a few seconds repeating every 20 seconds. Sometimes you have to restart it to get it to come back. There's interface problems... select 'movies' and you get an A-Z list... now scroll down and click on a movie then hit back to continue searching and your back at the start of the list. FYI reinstalled app twice. Only app that blacks out.,2024-03-16 12:52:57,2
"I am getting a lot of in-app requests to rate the app, even though I previously rated it 2 stars. I changed to 1 star. There are no subtitles for non-English dialog. I have to turn on subtitles to understand the dialog, but then get subtitles for all dialog. This app does not work with chromecast that well. When I'm browsing rows of movies/tv, it randomly scrolls up. Nothing good to say. Will cancel now that Halo is finished. Might renew for season 3, but will wait for entire season to release.",2024-03-22 21:14:03,1
"Although this is far better than Paramount's LGTV app that's not saying much. I've never used another app with so many HUGE bugs and usability issues. How a streaming app can't figure out ""when exiting playback, record the current progress"" I have no idea. On pixel devices the gesture bar is permanently lit. This issue was reported YEARS ago. Use picture in picture the go back to full screen? You'll get a dark square on the video until you quit the app. Incompetence, pure and simple.",2024-02-29 17:43:38,1
"Paramount is extremely buggy. I wouldn't recommend it to my best friend, I've had a recurring bug that removes audio with noway to restore it, been switching to Netflix when this happens. I've googled and it's a common issue of the last 2 years. Another thing, to unsubscribe they make it difficult by stating go back to where you installed the app from and unsubscribe from there, I had no idea for the longest time so I was getting charged monthly until I figured out it was this play store.",2024-03-16 08:49:48,1
"Worst streaming app. Subtitles for other languages are broken. Just watching Halo, there's no subtitles for the aliens. When you turn on English subtitles, they are so out of sync that it's unwatchable. Also, it won't let you restart episodes it just repeatedly starts at the credits. Also, sometimes, the sound goes out of sync. Unwatchable on my LG C3 OLED TV. I switched to this app instead of going through Amazon Prime due the half price for a year, huge mistake.",2024-03-15 13:32:21,1
"My advice . Do not install nor pay for this subscription. This is unequivocally the worst streaming service app I've encountered. Cannot watch on it on my smart TV. Buffers , stops , crashes, error messages at every press of a button. You can't even negotiate the home screen nor menu without an error Furthermore the range of shows and movies is dire . I only purchased the subscription for the sport Criminal that these people charge for the service, with zero intention of fixing it",2024-03-18 10:49:31,1
"Needs work!! The app doesn't seem to remember the last episode of a series you were on before exiting. He needs brightness control as it doesn't minic screen brightness increases within the app. Otherwise, it's good but not as good as Disney or Netflix apps in terms of functionality, in my opinion. The exit bar staying visible is beyond annoying. Possible work around. Sub via prime video as you will view it via the Prime Video app. I agree regards Halo. A lack of subtitles on alien dialogue.",2024-03-06 18:04:56,1
"This app buffers so much while playing on TV. We have Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney which run so well. Internet is not an issue as other apps run fine. But Paramount your OTT Platform is not optimized to be run on TV. I am a fan of Star Trek and joined just because of that. But the buffering is soo soo bad that I will need to leave you as I cant be bothered to watch it on Mobile. Will join later just for the love of Star Trek if your OTT platform is optimized for TV's also!",2024-04-12 13:51:25,1
This is quite poor for a paid subscription. Playback fails often and the volume on some shows is terrible. I find it crazy that these individual studios charge similar prices to netflix and prime when they have about a quarter of the content. Also there are shows like survivor that are not on the UK version of the app yet we pay the same as the US version.will rarely subscribe. EDIT: Six months later and it's worse.so laggy.,2024-04-10 10:57:48,1
"Someone wrote that this app is worse than wowtv, which i honestly couldn't belive. i didn't think that there's an streaming app out there that is worse than wow... Paramount proved that there can be something worse. It doesn't matter if i try to stream on my mobile phone or my tablet, the same thing happens all the time. Sidebar doesn't dissappear, the subtitles just moves around the screen, where the actor is ... this is really annoying and doesn't really let me enjoy a movie, or a show.",2024-04-15 23:26:02,1
"I signed up on the day it became available, the content has improved a little bit since then, however there is still so much you can add on, as for the app itself, absolutely pathetic, watching a TV show, you have to remember where you are up to, or it starts from the beginning, same with movies, I've had the same 3 items on my continue to watch list for months, yet I finished them ages ago, honestly I don't know why I bought the year subscription, I'd expect way better from Paramount.",2024-03-08 18:25:45,1
"Genuinely, the worst of the streaming services. It's laggy. It doesn't remember your watched stuff or your progress. (reinstalled, tried everything, been like it for over a year. I've checked their support and help etc, but all useless). Cust service is non existent. Not loads of choice to warrant a long term subscription. you'll probably run out of stuff you like relatively quickly. But in general, it's a stress to use and most of the time I don't both browsing it unless I'm desperate",2024-03-10 17:16:00,1
Lots of good shows but the interface Is lacking. Have to readd subtitles everytime you close the app. No like or dislike show option (not a big deal just a nice option). One of the bigger complaints would be lack of subtitles on certain shows; Halo and star trek discovery are 2 examples full dialogue scenes when alien species are speaking with no subtitles or context what's going on. Overall recommended to try it out there's enough good options to keep you entertained.,2024-03-20 16:35:40,3
App is very unstable. Crashes on multiple devices. Downloading is troublesome. Does not go full screen. App just keeps getting worst. Doesn't download properly. Can't even scroll through shows right. Doesn't save any of the shows I want. Brutal. Needs complete overhaul of the app.,2024-03-01 23:46:19,1
Why doesn't it sync with the TV app?? I go to my watchlist and nothings there that I added from the mobile app. The number of errors and oversights Paramount has compared to other streaming services is just ridiculous. Also you can't control the volume anymore for some reason. Via the phone app or TV. It's like you have a To-Do list of issues to create,2024-03-27 08:47:27,2
"I have it on my TV too as I don't like streaming on my phone. It goes from wide-screen to a squashed box shape screen. It's horrible and it's recent episodes too from about 4yrs ago. It makes the picture look distorted and compacted. Most of the eps are in wide-screen then next ep this happens. It also has episodes doubled up like on NCIS Sydney. It has 2 of each and says one is unavailable, but when streaming it stops and I have to manually select the available episode. Edit: cancelled it!",2024-04-05 20:13:42,2
"The app is a scam! Xbox Ultimate GamePass was offering 1 month free trial for standard streaming for $9.99 per month. After I registered w/ banking info, the app wouldn't work on any of my devices! During my 1 month trial, I was only able to watch 1 MOVIE before crashing w/ error codes. I contacted Support & got no help & excuses ""they're fixing it & contact Support for help."" Update: 1 month trial ends today, March 13, and now the app is finally working within the last hours of the trial. BS.",2024-03-13 22:04:23,1
Does not seem to know you have deleted downloads. I have deleted app and reinstalled. Changed user name ( on the off chance this should log out anyone who has hacked account) Changed password. It still thinks I have too many downloads and I have zero downloads. After emailing a few times it worked again. For a while and now can't download anymore again. There is no option to delete all downloads there is no option to log out all users. Seems the only option is to update your credit card,2024-03-23 19:40:04,1
Soo janky still no progress saving for how far you've watched and if you pause and lock phone it just black screens and fails. Can't even watch it on the website just comes up error page it's been out a while now weird they can't do the basics. Try force people into using only you for shows and pay for it at least make a decent platform to use.,2024-03-07 16:26:06,1
"Periodic! The app watching on my phone 5☆'s The app watching on tv 3☆'s This is why i gave 4☆'s Several times since downloading the app on my tv, it freezes then i get a blank/ black screen. Yes I've gone out and back into the app. Doesn't work. Yes I've uninstalled, then reinstalled. Doesn't work. Yes I've turned my tv off and back on. Doesn't work.

"Can't knock paramount, was sick of Netflix so on a recommendation I've given them a try. The app works well on phone, laptop and TV, fairly simple jumping across platforms mid program.

"Horrible app that never works. I have android and a Pixel 8 pro. It crashes all the time, it streams very badly on my Samsung TV. Worst part is: I still have to used the android app because the Samsung app on my tv just doesn't work. Long story short: it is a shame that paramount charges the same as Netflix with an app that bad. Do better paramount.",2024-03-05 03:38:30,1
"Easy to sign up and start paying, easy enough to play on my devices. Now, try to get the subtitles (CC) to work properly...it's like a toss up. You never know. My biggest issue is how to cancel. I'm moving and not sure how it's gonna go, so I wanna cancel for now. The website tells me to use the app. The app tells me to use the website, and I can't actually cancel.... Yeah. Kinda shtty. It's like when you try to get a refund sometimes. Immaculate charge, 5 business day refund...😒💁",2024-03-21 04:23:19,2
"10/09/23 Ok it streams. That part works. But play pause doesn't work via Bluetooth. Onscreen navigation buttons never go away. Same for quick bars on tablets.

No skip to next episode when credits start. 17/03/24 Nothing has changed.",2024-03-17 10:30:00,2
"DO NOT SUBCRIBE! Halo subtitles do not work. You have to turn off subtitles to get Alien subtitles or turn on captions via app and then when you switch between them, the English subtitles stop working for hard of hearing. When you get to the end episode of series 1 the subtitles go extra fast so you can't read the aliens, it's almost as if P+ doesn't want you to understand the storyline!",2024-03-25 17:42:37,1
The streaming is okay. Here are the major problems: 1) application has bugs. not too many but enough to be annoying. (i.e it hangs on downloads meaning you start the download but nothing happens) 2) very little percentage of your movie/series have download available. since I have subscribed to you (I watch on train ride) my cellphone bills are doubled. 3) your app cannot manage loss of internet connection midstream gracefully. I have seen at least three types of error as well as app hanging,2024-02-29 15:35:31,2
"This app is so buggy it's incredible . Every time I try to open it, it closes automatically.

"Really quite an appalling app, can't see how they managed to get it so wrong. Have to disable WiFi every time I use it as if it picks up a WiFi signal it just tells me an ""unspecified error has taken place"" and crashes. Can't even work out how to exit the programme I'm watching without swiping the whole the app off the screen?

Sent screenshots etc. Despite reassurances that their technical team were working on it, it is now the 10th of April, with no updates or contact. I have now cancelled my subscription.

"Improvements have been made but scenes that had built in captions are gone. All the alien scenes in halo just say (mercy, in alien language) then fades out and we're left with 5 minutes of dialogue we can't understand.

I'll proba ly canel service after watching this series.",2024-03-23 21:29:56,3
The fact I took the time to write a review speaks volumes about how bad the app is. I installed it to download some movies to watch on a flight. The app lacks basic functionality and wouldn't stop crashing before it eventually wiped the videos I downloaded. All I was was left to do on my flight was curse Paramount.,2024-04-16 02:11:19,1
Downloaded content still buffers when signal is weak/non-existent. Tried turning airplane mode on for smoother viewing but then just errors out and won't play at all. What's the point of the download function if it doesn't work? Terrible UX which is frustrating when the content is ultimately pretty good,2024-04-07 09:14:37,1

I've been reading the comments and I am super surprised that there is so many people that have been having problems with this app. I haven't had any problems I find that the app works fine on my television my laptop and my cell phone. I have a request for the people at Paramount + Would it be possible if you guys could get some of the original Paramount movies the black and white ones on this app please. I love watching the really old movies from Paramount.,2024-02-28 14:11:48,5

Takes a while to match voices to match up with the video but not the end of the world but the worst thing and it'd a big one. There are no subtitles for other languages spoken in predominantly English spoken shows. And for halo there are rarely subs for alien speech. It's a joke. What are you doing paramount. Everyone says how bad your app is and you do nothing to fix it. Waste of money,2024-03-01 20:49:07,1

Low res. & bitrate means content looks kinda meh on even a really high spec. TV , phone & tablet is better, but barely. Netflix, YouTube & Prime are all better options!",2024-04-19 02:26:31,2
"The programs i watch are great, but they are few and far between. Like a lot of apps, there are a lot of old recycled programs. If we here in Australia could just have the same programs as the USA, I'm sure i could give them a higher rating. But at this time, with this poor selection, this is all they will get from me.",2024-04-18 06:19:51,3

Can't find subscription in Google, PayPal, Android App Store, Paramount Plus, Prime, Amazon, or anywhere else. Can't find it, can't cancel it. Didn't realise it's been charging me since 17.08.23.

The subtitles don't work correctly in this app... Turning them on disables the translations that are supposed to be there normally. Meaning you can either have subtitles - but no translation. Or translation but no subtitles....,2024-04-22 10:47:09,1

"Doesn't even have an app for consoles, you have to stream from their website like you're pirating a movie in the early 2000s. Shockingly basic. Very poor selection of shows. Paramount should be selling their content to other platforms because they look pretty pathetic up against the selections on proper streaming services. If you don't like Southpark or StarTrek, you like me will find this a very lacking selection indeed.",2024-04-15 14:07:27,2
"I encountered a bug on my android tv when using Bluetooth earbuds, it paused in the middle of a show to buffer and when it resumed the sound did not work at all. I checked the sound on other devices and my TV sound worked in other apps. I had to reinstall the app. Force stop and a hard reset did not fix it. I dont know if my earbuds were related to the bug",2024-03-19 02:19:28,3
"It's pretty bad. I'm stuck in a loop not able to rewatch a video. It has 3 seconds before the next episode dial comes up. Frustrating how it doesn't remember where you left off.

On both my Samsung tablet and Samsung TV the keep watching is not keeping track of the episodes I've watched and doesn't resume when partially viewed and yes I've tried all the usual tips. If it is showing the exact same problem on two separate devices it must be down to Paramount. A year and a half later and Paramount plus is still not tracking my watched episodes.,2024-03-13 22:19:25,1
Paramount are making no attempt to fix the constant buffering so I have canceled my account for good. Its done it since the day I have subscribed. I have done all the troubleshooting that was recommendeded and more. Paramount blaming it on my Internet is laughable when the app is the common denominator. All my other streaming services work perfectly fine. The fact you charge what you charge is theft as your service is broken and is not holding up its end,2024-02-27 21:14:55,1
"Worst streaming service app in Australia needs improvements for Google TVs full of glitches and watching sports on it is glitches, Kayo is much better biggest waist of money for the cost of it I'd rather pay more for Kayo. As for watching shows you can't even get through an episode without restarting it 2 or 3 times how did these guys even get the contract to become a streaming service?? Should be a $2 service because that's all they offer you blury, glitchy and frozen most of the time.",2024-03-23 01:44:38,1
"Between watching on the app and TV, paramount didn't remember which episode of your show and how far into that episode you are so you have to constantly skip between episodes and within the episode to get to the point where you left off. The subtitles are slow, appearing after the lines have been said, often running several lines behind so you see the action before you read the subtitles. On Halo, the alien dialogue isn't translated at all on the app, only on the TV app so pointless.",2024-03-31 16:35:33,2
Being double billed. They don't make it easy to talk to someone. Some how I'm being billed from my Amazon account as well on my credit card. I had to cancel my whole Amazon Prime just to cancel Paramount. And cancel Paramount because apparently I have two! How does THIS happen? I love Paramount + but not enough to pay for it twice. So now I have to wait to see if I still have the other Paramount + or if they both stopped. It is virtually impossible to talk to an actual human. And the chatbot is,2024-03-26 03:04:03,2
For some reason the app keeps pausing for no reason & have to reboot the app which would be fine if I could select & finish the episode I want to watch but seems to just start the next episode every time! Twisted metal is where I'm having all the problems! I even had to download the episodes to help!,2024-04-09 11:59:49,3
This app is not stable. On both my phone and PC it will randomly crash. It's almost guaranteed to stop playing whatever content you're watching if you attempt to skip 10 seconds forward. Get used to seeing OPTIMISING VIDEO PLAYBACK after you try to skip forward.,2024-04-05 21:35:48,3
"it's a great app overall, but I just wish you could download whatever show that's on the app. my favorite is rise of the teenage mutant ninja turtles, and I can't even download it! and I'm paying a subscription! I honestly just want that one show to be available to download, but overall, great app",2024-04-13 04:40:19,4
Does not save your place to resume playback. Exceedingly cumbersome to use with an Android box. It is not easy nor comprehensive to browse for content. It is one of the least enjoyable interfaces among streaming services. Feels like a complete rush job with next to no planning.,2024-03-17 03:48:39,2
Only 4K and Atmos gets full 5 stars. Bit of a piss poor launch in the UK with HD 5.1. The US had 4K Dolby Vision so the UK should of been in line with the US at launch. They have fixed most but still some titles only have 2.0 and not 5.1 audio and still waiting on the 4K launch. Please add matching FPS to the app as well. This would make it a good experience rather.,2024-04-04 14:46:42,3
Good for the most part. Frustrated that if I don't watch a series for a certain amount of time my progress of watched shows disappears. Also not sure why they removed csi season 16 on the app but I have to pay for paramount on amazon separately just to watch certain seasons. Not cool,2024-04-14 04:53:18,3
"I stop short of a 5th star because the app has a truly frustrating tendency to burp, fart and vomit every 20 to 30 seconds; the techno nerds will call it a screen refresh but it's a fart. In that moment, everything moves if only for a fraction of a second, but it's still long enough for the most slow witted to notice.",2024-03-18 16:53:37,4
"Subtitles on shiws like Halo don't work properly and haven't for months - in this case, anything spoken in not-English (alien languages) has no subtitles. In addition, your subscription fails to work if you leave your country of subscription. Overall, a mediocre service with a limited selection of good content.",2024-03-06 04:21:45,2
This is the worst of tv apps. Won't open a lot of times saying I need Internet connection even whwn I've got downloaded things to watch. App crashes a lot and often the TV shows stop when watching. I stick with it because I'm forced to if I want to watch something in particular.,2024-04-07 17:32:39,1
"Okay let's break this down. The content is pretty good. Lots of choice there and especially sci fi. The problem Is with the app itself. The UX is poor and the app Often doesn't remember where you were with a series, especially if you're watching across different player sources. No excuse for this these days.",2024-03-21 10:21:22,2
While I was one my xbox there was a 30 day trial offer and figured I'd give it a try since I was interested in watching Halo. Not only did a recieve I charge after 7 days the subtitles didnt work while I was watching Halo which is needed due to an alien race speaking their own language. On top of that I strongly suggest keeping a note on which device you signed up to this streaming service because when you go to cancel you need to sign in on the first device and app or browser to do so,2024-02-29 22:44:32,1
"Selection is not huge but good. Unfortunately, this app answers the question, is it possible to make a streaming app that is much worse than Wow with a resounding yes. Downloads often don't work, subtitles sometimes don't, and when I watch a clip from the extras section of a show, eg meet the cast for special ops lioness, the app automatically plays the ""next"" clip: episode 8 or rabbit hole. Of course. Good thing this was free with another service, in its current state it's not worth paying for.",2024-02-26 19:51:51,1
"Great library, great picture and sound quality (no uhd yet!). The app suffers from the usual technical problems, the worst of which is that it doesn't save your last position, in fact mine doesn't appear to have a ""continue watching"" row at all! One month later: still the same! Support got back to me, I explained the problems and I never heard back.",2024-02-09 19:37:28,1
"This needs work. Where to start? Downloaded content doesn't always restart where you left off. If you jump back into a programme you're halfway through, it'll default to streaming and start from the beginning unless you go through the downloads menu, but that doesn't always work either. And don't bother watching Halo. Great series but had to give up as the alien language subtitles don't work. Which means you're missing half the script. Content is great, app is shambolic.",2024-02-07 19:19:14,1
"Reading other people's experiences I thought I was in for a bad time, but wanted to watch some star trek. So far I've had no problems. Ok, fine, I do experience some glitchy movements in the app when scrolling, and the control buttons don't disappear in full screen mode, but nothing that disturbs the experience. No streaming issues. And it's a reasonable price, no strings attached monthly contract. Happy with what I paid for",2024-02-18 13:33:50,5
"Utter garbage app on Android phone. The navigation tab is displayed on the side of the screen during all content & can't be disabled. Totally distracting! Have since discovered people have been complaining about this for well over a year. So Paramount either doesn't know how to fix this or just can't be bothered. I haven't had this issue on any other video player or app I've ever used anywhere online, so there's your answer. Avoid!",2024-02-14 23:39:17,1
"The tool bar on my tablet is always visual when watching a video this is a problem I only have on paramount plus and is extremely annoying and spoils the viewing experience. Downloads are unavailable offline which seems to defeat the point. Many series will not allow downloads for the entire season which again defeats the point. Who wants to download episodes 1, 4 and 6 of a series to watch on a journey. Content is good but the app is poor.",2024-02-25 13:05:26,1
"Worst streaming app ever is an understatement. This is the only app I've ever had that will freeze to the point where I can't do anything but restart my phone. It will still be playing in a weird cut off corner kind of way. Can't close it, can't rotate the phone to get it back to the normal aspect ratio, can't back out of it. Works ok on the TV but you can't even use it on your mobile device. Garbage all around",2024-02-16 14:12:26,1
"Definitely needs improvement, I do not like at all. Recently downloaded and switched from streaming it through Prime to this app on the TV, what a mistake that was!!

Also, there are issues with the searching functions, pretty much doesnt work.",2024-02-09 08:48:32,1
"Genuinely the worst streaming service I have ever used. It has decent content, but getting it to play without error is rare. Constant glitching and buffering issues, out of sync sound are the worst of it. Taking over 45 seconds to get halfway through the word ""previously"", then telling me that the episode is unavailable. Ridiculous. Never had this problem with Netflix, Amazon or Disney. Even with a free 7 day trial I feel ripped off.",2024-02-14 11:20:51,1
"What a terrible streaming app. I have used most of the streaming apps out there and this is the worst. The app can't figure out when a show is over and to go onto the next. Most of the time it can't remember where I left off in a show. You would think Paramount with a vault full of over a 100 years of movies they would have great selection. No, it is a tiny selection of features and there is not even a classics section. I have tried 6 major streaming services and this is by far the worst.",2024-02-27 03:19:04,1

System display brightness also set to the max, and it's completely unusable. Subtitles show up clear as day, everything else? Nothing. Attempted to watch some Halo at work while it's slow, in 15 minutes i saw a face once, a computer screen display, and that's basically it. Un-usable. 0/5.",2024-02-16 15:49:44,1
"Terribly inconsistent. Every show has had errors playing properly on both my phone and my Sony Bravia. The most common issue being absolutely no sound on random episodes for ALL shows that I've watched. Restarting, clearing cache, reinstalling, none of it helps. There is no consistency between devices either. What plays fine on my PC or mobile, doesn't on my tv. This is a poorly planned, rushed app with many frustrating bugs and will likely be the reason why I cancel my subscription",2024-01-31 14:43:29,1

"Worse than basically every other option. Lacking basic features, not having all seasons of shows they own the rights to as well as the episodes of the seasons they do have being super desaturated (look at 1987 TMNT for a great example). Even the free trial is only one week compared to the month you get with Prime, and that service has more content on it along with giving you access to fast shipping for online purchases. If you want to watch the stuff on here, I'd advise sailing the seven seas.",2024-02-13 07:29:13,1
"Absolutely Fantastic, get it at no extra cost through sky. Even if I didn't have sky based on the monthly cost v content it's worth every penny.

Total con and in Scream 6 one of the characters has 'Lavender' sprawled across her jumper. Make of that what you will. But i know what thats referring too a year before oct 7 even happened.

Worst app for viewing content ever. I got 4 months free membership and will not be renewing inspite of the good content they have. You have to put up with 5 minutes of the app glitching before you can view anything. It does not remember your last viewed so ve prepared to fast forward a lot- but oh wait the app hung in the middle of FF. So start all over again.

Loving this app! But the mobile version needs a serious patch. Subtitles on or off with different with languages spoken in video aren't translated to English as they are on the TV version app. This makes the videos unwatchable on the mobile version.,2024-03-15 03:13:46,5
I have to uninstall and re-install every time I want to use the app. I only persist as some of my favourite shows are on Paramount otherwise it would have been long gone. You would think a Multi-million dollar company could come up with a better app.,2024-03-26 02:17:57,1
Experience marred by paramounts inability to add subtitles to any movie or series where aliens are speaking specially new halo series.

"For self confessed ""football heads"" their playback of love sport is atrocious. You can only watch a match live when it has started. Other sport apps allow you to start from the beginning no matter if it is live. Furthermore, once the match has finished live streaming it is not uploaded to watch for ages. For people that are time poor this is a terrible lack of function and needs to be rectified. A serious lack of understanding for sports fans",2024-02-28 22:20:28,1
Good overall but the mobile app needs some work. Subtitles that work on PC don't always work on phone or tablet and the small bar at the bottom of the screen that doesn't dissappear is unnecessary.,2024-03-25 19:27:27,4

Why does the app freeze almost every time I watch live sport on my TV. No other app does this. I have to force turn off the TV to get control back. I am concerned it will kill my tv,2024-03-21 09:17:24,2

UPDATED REVIEW: Email communication was fast and subscription cancelled easy enough. Still was unable to complete this myself though and had to rely on assistance. Hopefully this changes in the near future. ORIGINAL: There is no way to cancel the free trial. This alone makes me not want to continue with the subscription. Great way to keep charging people who do not even want the service..,2024-02-15 02:09:00,3
"Couple of improvements needed, I work very remote so I need to download content for later consumption. It's impossible to open the app without a connection so I am still unable to watch any downloads with no connection at all. Also there's no indication of the percentage of download so no way of telling how long I have to wait for something to download. Also a very limited choice in movies. I will likely cancel my subscription after the month is up.",2024-02-19 05:21:47,3

"Good TV wrapped in a buggy app The app is obviously still a work in progress. It lacks many quality of life features like subtitle adjustment, variable speed playback, and is generally quite buggy and slow. This is partly the app's fault, and partly because Paramount still seem to be working out how to best optimise their servers. Overall, they seem to have a decent enough selection of shows, notably including the classic Frasier and South Park. That said, it's still a bit behind Netflix ...",2023-12-25 05:15:41,3
"Please fix your bugs. While I'm browsing, the refresh is acting like I just entered the app. Then it scrolls down to where I was looking for the most part. After it does that about 4 times, the screen goes black. I have to hit another tab and then go back and start over. A low interval is NOT your friend and shouldn't be required. Please QA and patch asap. Everything else seems to be ok. Thanks!",2023-12-19 17:47:56,2

Although I don't expect a huge catalog for this price, I do expect basic quality - what's the point when you can't watch anything. Regret.",2023-12-28 21:27:39,1
The app doesn't always sync with your devices and won't restart from where you last left viewing. It's totally random whether it does it or not. It's a nightmare. The 3 navigation buttons remain visible on screen. (Android) This is very poor from Paramount. Please find a company that can produce a functional cross platform application for paying customers. Paramount Customer Support can't help.,2024-01-27 15:09:42,1
"One of the worst streaming apps. When starting a show or movie it begins in low resolution for 30 seconds or so before switching to a proper resolution. If you rewind it goes back to that low resolution until it can catch up. Every other app has this figured out, not sure why Paramount can't. When scrolling content it randomly kicks you back up to the top. Subtitles are delayed from when words are spoken, and if you set it to always have subtitles on it doesn't save your preference. Terrible app",2023-11-24 13:24:27,1
"Really bad app. Random whether you get continue watching, so you have to remember where you where during a film/show. Even if it does work, it's probably behind where you left off. Doesn't seem to sync between devices. Real shame you can't link to Prime as that's the only place you can watch on some devices. Who is going to pay twice? Seems like a complete rush job to compete with better streaming services. Scrolling and using back button jumps back to beginning, not where you left off. BAD.",2024-01-07 18:45:23,2

I can't find where my card information is kept either. The subtitles and language settings are not with the show. You have to go all the way to settings to find them.

It doesn't seem to save where it was playing so well so I am constantly having to find my spot again, the shows open up back at the first season instead of where I am and there's no lock screen while playing. At least it will play while on other apps. Worst streaming service app IMO.",2023-11-22 18:27:55,2
Absolutely pathetic. The only reason I even use your terrible service is for the A League and if I had any other option I would be using it. When Chromecasting it's constantly glitchy and needing to be restarted. You finally provide the app through the Xbox and it's somehow worse. To watch a 90 minute game I have to close the app and restart at least 8-10 times as the screen freezes and it's the only way to get the stream going again. Worst service I have ever had the displeasure of using,2023-12-18 08:51:32,1

App has a plethora of issues including video files not loading or taking a few minutes to load; loading with no sound; problems with the casting; terrible buffering; reacting very slow to navigating. When experiencing each of these issues I have trialled on other streaming apps immediately and had no issues on any of them.

Don't do it! They make it impossible to cancel. Only interested in your money. App is rubbish Keeps crashing. Update: Viacom kindly replied and sent me a link to their troubleshooting page - every problem that arises appears to be caused by the household using the app. IlStrange!

I am unable to cancel subscription within the application after a trial period. Other noteworthy complaints are the constant refreshing / posting of the Paramount logo between searches or while scrolling through content options. Edit: after signing up for a free trial through the application the non mobile website won't let you cancel as well. So in app I can change to an annual subscription but can't cancel and online I can't cancel either. I literally need to block it with Google Play. Thanks,2023-11-30 00:37:02,2

The con is, the app is very glitches, for example while browsing through the content, periodically it keeps resetting and disappearing then resets and comes back randomly.

It forgets what episode you're on and only displays partial subtitles when casting to a TV. With shows like Halo where characters speak languages other than English the subtitles seem to only show for English dialogue scenes but not for the foreign spoken scenes. Only when you switch the subtitles off the alien language scenes show up with subtitles. Lack of decent subtitles makes the app difficult to use for people with hard of hearing.,2023-11-26 08:33:09,2
"Oh dear. This app is good for about one episode but forgets where you left off past that episode. I have an awful memory, I shouldn't have to renavigate and wrack my brain to remember where I was in the next episode. This app should refresh and remember these things! Please fix this, its painful to use this app.",2024-03-09 22:22:03,1

I only paid for it to watch south park but it won't allow me to browse through earlier episodes anymore. planning to cancel and just buy the episodes on prime. had an issue with them before where they cancelled my subscription but kept charging me for 8 months and then never refunded me for the months they charged but I still had no access to the service. don't waste your money.,2023-12-14 18:43:02,1

Subtitles use device settings & sometimes are truncated even if text size = medium on Android. It should have its own native subtitles. Pros: Good movies & shows, 1st month so far. Better than DSNY and NFLX, not good as HBO but if you live in CAN (no HBO Go), Crave is not functional. Hope resume & subs support get fixed.",2023-11-13 18:58:13,3

Maybe a collective of customers should hit up the Telecommunications Ombudsman for the poor service and compensation.",2024-02-24 08:49:19,1

"Works ok on phone but... This app needs to decide whether it's going to convert an unintelligible language into English or not! Trying to watch Halo, season one episode one it translated the prophet language in subtitles, season one episode two it doesn't!

Also I notice lately the same movies keep coming up again and again.",2024-02-17 20:10:08,5

It's okay resolution can be very bad very pixel look as if it just can't steam right and they should have left mastercheif alone and focused on a different character maybe even a knew one and just cameo him in but overall its okay also alot of shows with and halo also has a lot of scenes with alien and Korean that they don't subtitle not just a line or 2 but full scenes,2024-02-09 18:49:10,3
This app is so frustrating. Hasn't saved any of my continue watching 🙄. Now I've no idea what episode I was up to or even how far into one I was.

Love the new halo series but has a huge problem! After the first episode there are no subtitles for the covenant (aliens). This leaves big gaps in the story line. Very disappointing!!!,2024-02-22 19:09:34,2
Impressive TV shows but terrible app and subtitles - will NOT be buying a subscription. Obviously Paramount just wanted to jump on the streaming bandwagon and have done it on the cheap. Sort out the app and sort out the subtitles please and thank you,2024-02-18 16:53:40,1
Downloaded some shows to watch at work. It ended up streaming with my data even though I downloaded it and selected it from that folder. Lost all my data for the rest of the month. Also unable to unpause after pausing. Have to close and reopen app.,2023-11-27 02:12:40,3

"Rubbish. I've played a lot of Halo, but I still can't speak fluent Covenant. Is the non-human dialogue meant to be a secret to everyone else watching? Im pretty sure some subs would be useful. Turning them on in the apps options has no effect. And the rest of the app is frustrating and not up to par. I won't be renewing.",2023-11-18 01:37:52,1
this is my first time using paramount plus and I've got to say that its not as good as I hoped when you want to watch something the app struggles to let you view so you'd have to wait for the download before watching and there isn't much choices even though they have the channel choice available but only a few selections I'm not sold on this app as to wether or not I would like to continue my subscription as I have only found 4shows that I like and I've looked through the hole app choices,2023-12-03 13:51:49,1
haven't been using this app long but I like it so far. only problem I've noticed is that the subtitles suck. they work but they're not in sync with the audio. would really make matching more enjoyable if the subtitles worked properly,2023-11-22 10:36:13,4
Fix your subtitles. It's 2024. Whenever someone is speaking a foreign language while the show is in English there are no subtitles so the viewer can understand what's going on. I'm missing half the story because I don't know what the characters are talking about!!!,2024-04-02 12:15:16,1
"Worst application I've ever used. It's not as developed when compared to other streaming apps, but what gets me the most is that most of the content does NOT contain subtitles, for some people it's very necessary to watch content with subtitles, hopefully it changes in the future as the content itself is very entertaining",2023-11-30 04:54:49,2

"The android tv app itself is garbage. Freezing issues, and menu issues are the start. The kicker is missing foreign language subtitles on their own Paramount+ Originals, and missing seasons for shows that are available through the Paramount+ Channel within Prime Video.

It hasn't opened or allows access to the menu since the last 2 updates on my tablet 😕 all I get is the paramount sky blue open page and nothing else!

"This app is great it has a lot of different shows to watch old and new, the only reason it's 1 star is that it keeps glitching and lagging or just simply not playing any of the shows which it has been doing the past few days, I cancelled my subscription it will end within a few days if it's not fixed by then I'm leaving my subscription cancelled.",2023-11-15 01:02:53,1

Without a doubt the worst streaming app in existence. Nothing but buffering and crashing.,2024-04-13 11:52:57,1

Resume function doesn't work at all. Really frustrating. Either starts episode you just finished or restarts episode you where watching And why is Freddie's Birthday listed twice in Frasier's episode list?,2024-03-02 14:08:14,2

"Then Ever I opened the app, and it doesn't load. So I'm not able to use the app at all. I would try to open the app every day to see if it works, but it doesn't work for me",2024-03-08 03:31:15,1
App on Sony Android TV no longer works. Click on a show to watch and it crashes back to the tv home screen,2024-03-13 11:43:09,1
Subtitles for foreign language scenes dont work. Some shows are practically unwatchable. Pathetic.,2024-03-25 03:44:22,1

Used to able to download content to watch offline but that feature has stopped working now most dissapointing was using Paramount as main bo tobut unfortunately not any more,2024-03-27 05:08:53,3

"Downloaded to stream the one show I'm interested, and the app is just a spinning circle. Won't play anything.",2024-04-05 00:13:55,1
I wanted 0 stars but its not an option. Paramount+ is the Worst streaming app ever. It never works. It constantly kicks you out. The movie won't play or keeps stopping. Absolutely a waste of money compared to any other streaming app,2024-02-15 16:40:51,1

"Just Alright ... Not sure if it's with other series but with the older 90210 series, a lot of the episodes are missing. I understand this could be a copyright issue with the music but you lose major plot lines and serious episodes seem to be removed as well (suicide, murder, etc ) . THE ENDING IS EVEN MISSING.

The app is horrific. The home screen buggs every few seconds where it flashes black and the navigation bar/ task bar does not disappear when watching something in full screen. I've seen better developed apps from solo developers. You have no excuse.,2023-12-30 18:53:29,1
"Try watching programs with the app for my TV, its keeps on stopping and asking me to resume the program and also keeps freezing, it freezes on my mobile app aswell, it's a load of c**p, I'm going to cancel subscription, I can't see the point carry on with it if I can't watch anything without something going wrong",2023-11-08 10:13:03,1
Translation / subtitles don't work for Halo when using the app. Can't make it through episode 1 of halo because the episode isn't translating the alien speech. It needs to be fixed. App also has lots of freezing even though I have a 1gig download speed. Please fix the bugs.,2024-01-09 02:25:26,1
"Went to sign up for the free trial and was charged the monthly subscription instantly. This contradicts all the marketing that says charge won't apply untill trial ends.

"It's extremely frustrating how often the videos ""optimise"" or the app says its ""experiencing technical difficulties"" and then closes itself. Makes it so hard to watch an episode.

Full of bugs. Frequently fails to fully open. Drops to low quality video a lot at times where the three other streaming services I have installed work perfectly at very high resolution. Needs a lot of work. Latest error was about technical difficulties... I pay for this garbage...,2023-12-20 10:02:06,1
"The app is ok. I thought there would be a lot more in terms of selection of movies or tv shows. No ""continue watching"" section so if you want to come back to something later, you have to watch the whole thing from the beginning. That part is annoying but other than that, it's fine",2024-01-03 22:45:50,3
"Awful! Can't even cancel my subscription!! Set up a subscription to watch a TV show that Paramount+ advertised, only to discover you don't have the show at all!!!

Signed up to watch Halo. Turns out an update back on the 9th of Nov has removed the subtitles from the cut scenes with the Aliens talking which makes the show unwatchable. I've reported it and asked for updates multiple times now with the response being it they will let the content team know. Very disappointed! EDIT in response to the developers response to me. I have already reported this even sent you guys pic and video of the issue. Still waiting on you to fix.,2023-12-22 01:45:22,2
there are good TV series and movies on but errors keep popping up and if there is a film series they only have some of them which is a bit stupid and if the people in a tv series or a film are speaking in a different language no subtitles show what they are speaking so miss out on what they are saying and makes it pointless in watching that scene now I've just noticed that some tv shows don't have all the seasons not even the first season so it gone from a 2* to a 1*,2024-01-14 17:44:49,1
So I just got my tablet back cause I was grounded and I thought it was just like that cause I didn't use it for some time but sitting here and reading the reviews it not my tablet being slow other people are dealing with the laggy for 20 or 30 seconds of the movie randomly glitch you back to the top and some other things. I love this app(but not the glitches they need to be fixed rn) but be warned of these things if you don't have patience.,2023-12-16 17:49:27,3

I just wanna watch my freaking show, man 😫🤬",2023-11-11 02:40:43,3

App is terrible on my Tablet I can't scroll down the list to find what else is available to watch as Paramount home screen keeps refreshing and taking me back to the top within seconds.

"I bought a subscription litterly for just South Park. Everything else on here is worthless, they should just licence the right to someone else and delete this app it's awful. There isn't one other interesting this on the app and it's not even a good app, as you scroll down to browse it jumps around as content loads; rookie mistakes. Just close this app and tell rights to netflix or something ffs",2023-12-26 10:29:39,1
"Stupid app, always has errors showing a league replays, you can't pause live games or go back either. Dumb set up and no worth the money at all, Australian soccer will suffer thanks to paramounts televising rights. Don't get this. The shows are average too and they only have one or two big names on there.",2023-11-26 11:19:05,1
"I subscribed to watch FA Cup, Asian Cup and the A-League Soccer. Many FA Cup games were not available (4th round Bournemouth v Swansea, 3rd round replays Wolves v Brentford, Everton v Crystal Palace etc no highlights or repeats were available for these games either). The excuse was that Paramount+ did not have the rights, however the advertising states ""see it live! Watch every match ....of the FA Cup live"" Broadcasts stutter/freeze, customer service is dismissive and almost non existent.",2024-01-26 07:47:23,1
Awful UX. Doesn't remember where you are or what you were watching. Can't even find its big name franchises on the home screen without either scrolling forever or resorting to search. Occasionally will reset an episode in the middle of playing.,2024-01-16 21:20:57,2

Horrible experience. The app on my LG tv constantly crashes. Paramount replied to my issue by giving me a suggested fix which is incompatible with my TV. Watching sport on paramount is a horrible experience.,2024-01-07 06:44:14,1
I have been trying to resolve an issue through their email. they have no way to contact them via phone and although my issue is not being resolved they still won't call me.

"If you don't like the premier league, this app is pretty hopeless. 1. Can't download everything that's available to watch 2. Offline watching doesn't always work 3. There are hardly any films or shows worth watching. Not worth the price for this little content",2023-12-14 00:45:13,2
"Taken away all Star Trek, no email, and almost impossible to cancel. You must cancel on the device you set it up on. Yeah, I no longer have it, It was probably easier to decode, an ancient language",2023-12-02 08:22:28,1

"- Resetting to start with film/show list makes adding things PAINFUL. (ENDLESS scrolling loop!) - Sluggish playback renders everything stuttery. EVEN when DOWNLOADED. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy A31, ALL other streaming video services WORK. FIX IT!",2024-01-03 14:24:01,1
Worse streaming app barely anything on to watch took money out when it is supposed to be free trial I definitely won't be keeping this app movies are out of sync have to stop and start again all the time to get it back in sync absolutely terrible,2024-01-07 02:34:03,1
I only got it for the ALeague and have to dig every time to find the match I want. Always starts from live with no option to start from beginning. No fixture guide. Regularly crashes. Hopeless all round.,2023-12-23 05:25:20,1

Paramount is a really good app especially for charmed but the bad thing is you can't skip intro's.😎,2024-04-20 10:25:40,5
The app has heaps of glitches. The worst streaming app I have used. Will not save where I am in a show for starters,2024-03-26 22:41:49,1
"I love the programming. My only complaint is that you need to upgrade your servers. I get a warning on my ohone saying that Paramount Plus isn't configured for the newer version of Samsung. It'll work but will freeze when trying to exit the app. Watching the programs on my TV, the app is glitchy and lags. The voice doesn't match up with the lip movement on screen. When I start up the show, it replays the beginning part like a look. It is slow with strolling through the titles as well.",2024-02-28 01:59:50,4
The worst streaming app by far. Doesn't skip to next episode even though I set it to do so. It randomly swaps show entirely to star trek or some other dross. I have never used such a poor streaming service. Only signed up for free trial and I will not be paying nothing at the end of it. It needs major improvements. Could be alot simpler and easy to use as a customer.,2024-02-23 19:47:21,1
"Come on Paramount! Your app doesn't have a feature that remembers which episode I am watching yet the website does! That is surely a basic feature. It is so frustrating to have to remember, am I on episode 27 or 29? Fix this please! Also, when searching through the A-Z of movies, when you click on a movie to see more about it then click back, you return to the start of the list and have to scroll back through the whole list. It's such a frustrating feature",2024-02-28 21:28:35,1
"I don't like the user interface / layout of this app. It's not very user-friendly or intuitive as the other streaming apps. After exiting and reopening the app, I cannot find the last played video until scrolling down quite a bit... When playing the video, not many options given to view list of episodes of TV show, or play next (or previous) episode... cannot change subtitles or CC position on the screen, size or font... this app CRASHES OFTEN and NEEDS many many improvements!!!!!",2024-03-03 19:14:59,1
Horrible. Worst streaming app I've tried. And I've used all the main ones. I got it for Halo. It started on season 2. Almost finished the episode before I realized it. Ruined the whole experience. Rarely remembers where I am. Cuts out or doesn't work often. Fast forward is useless. Even scrolling through the app is a joke. Never once has it allowed me to skip through intros without crashing. And while watching it glitches. It was designed my people who have no clue what they were doing,2024-03-24 00:49:02,1
"Nearly impossible to unsubscribe. Money grubbing company. Well done paramount for how confusing you've made it to unsubscribe, I suppose you're betting on people to give up so you can keep taking their money. Bravo 👏",2024-04-22 02:37:17,1
Some good shows but horrible app across devices. If you put in a complaint about the many issues they just say they're aware of the problems and working to fix. Maybe one day it will be a good app. I'm literally only here for Halo now. I'd go elsewhere like OptusSports for the football,2024-02-01 12:03:16,2

"No ""continue watching"" feature is very frustrating. For a large company it's pretty poor if they are trying to compete with the other streaming platforms.",2024-01-08 19:16:43,2
"What is it with these subscription services that they don't do subtitles for the programs that have foreign or alien languages? Watching Halo and I had to rewind and manually turn on subtitles to find out what was being said in a 5 minute long scene! By episode 3 subtitles for the important bits don't exist at all and all you get is a load of irrelevant scene info. Considering it's a paid for service, this is unacceptable and I won't be renewing the subscription after the trial period.",2024-04-23 22:49:45,1
I will give 1 start until paramount+ fix this nonsese that if you are waching on browser doesn't save what are you waching on the app and viscera is kind basic function that should work from day one,2024-03-10 00:30:32,1
On an android phone you can't unsubscribe unless you contact paramount? Why is there not an option in settings or on your website where I can just hit cancel? Absolute joke,2024-03-13 07:09:03,1
"Does not work! Seems to have great shows and movies so subscribed, but can't be sure as app doesn't open. Simply doesn't open up and crashes. Had high hope",2023-11-17 22:50:14,1

"Just a terrible app, no subtitled language shown for alien Halo characters despite all attempts to display and the app just clogs up the TVs memory",2024-03-17 02:26:27,2
Would be 4 stars if my continued watching would save for more then a couple weeks like why do I have to go to a show i haven't watched in awhile and search for 20 mins to find the episode I was on,2024-03-11 07:10:10,2
App doesn't stop showing menu bar at the bottom and will constantly flip to the top,2024-03-03 00:27:50,2
Amazing app but i wish i could get love and hip hop Atlanta and other ones which you can only get in the us you should be able to get them anywhere if you have paramount plus please try and do it,2024-04-07 08:36:49,5
Good until it won't let me watch my shows due to an error every time I've tried it for the past 5 months,2024-04-07 04:26:41,3

Works lovely every time! No adverts smooth play from episode to episode.,2024-04-18 16:35:34,5

Great for movies and series. Easy to use and has a variety to watch.,2024-03-07 18:33:19,5
There are 2 main issues with the app. It doesn't remember where I left off or which episodes I have watched. I also watch on my TV using a Roku box and that works perfectly. The mobile app tends to reload when scrolling through the content library. Actual playback on my phone using data is perfect. I have none of the buffering issues that other people have complained about.,2024-01-07 15:34:22,3
"Shows are OK, app is horrible. Doesn't show all my favorites, will not resume a show, it starts over. When trying to fast-forward to the correct spot, it freezes. Can't get some movies, I select play, and it just spins and spins. I've tried it on phone, tv, firestick, none of them work properly. You would think paramount would have enough money to make a better app.",2024-01-04 15:46:24,1
Doesn't open the app anymore. Always watched it on this TV. Very frustrating!,2024-03-18 07:53:43,1
Terrible App experience lots of data buffering when streaming that I don't experience with other steaming apps. Poor menu layout unwatchable and frustrating. I'm very disappointed.,2024-02-16 13:31:50,1
"I have no issues with the price and content, but the app functions horribly. If I'm watching a series, I have to log back in after each episode. After logging back in, the next episode begins automatically, there is no app menu, or series menu. I have this function disabled, so it shouldn't happen. I have to keep track of the episodes I watch because the app randomly shows which episodes I have watched, but it's not consistent. To get back to the menu I have to wait xx hours or reinstall the app",2023-11-02 20:51:44,1
"Apart from South Park, this app has no content worth watching and it is so buggy that you have to continously delete it and reinstall it. It constantly freezes on an episode that you have watched in the past so that's always your ""continue watching"" save. It crashes majority of the time and won't let you download anything after you have attempted to download something without WiFi. It's also not working half the time so you have to switch over to a competitor to find something else.",2023-11-01 23:06:40,1
Worst app! You cant watch download movies when signal is weak or no internet. I download movie so i can watch it while on the plane. App is nothing like Netflix tbh. Nice movies but WORST app!!!!!,2023-11-23 15:38:06,1
Every app has issues n the quality of its shows is outstanding. You'll understand the love if you use the trial and watch its gems,2024-03-07 10:26:08,4

The app still needs a lot of work. It won't even launch in landscape orientation. Most things work but the controls aren't as easy to use as the competition.,2024-02-10 04:43:37,4
"the app constantly crashes on Google Play and Chomecast, meaning you can't watch it on the go. but seems to work fairly on Roku.",2024-02-06 05:53:55,2
Crashes daily. Forgets what country I'm in and restricts content. You can't pause or rewind live sports. When games are over you have to wait nearly 24 hours to watch the recording. UPDATED: Still terrible.,2024-02-10 10:24:10,2
For Android? Ok. For LG TVs? The slowest sack of sh¡t app you've dealt with. Takes forever to load and pauses to buffer way too often when all other streaming apps run fine.,2024-02-05 06:38:25,2
"I am a simple guy who doesn't get as excited as all the retards who left a review. App seems good, but Viacom (the mother ship) doesn't come through. I cancelled moments after I signed up for a free trial. Maybe someone will bring back blockbuster videos. Good luck Viacom...you kinda suck.",2024-02-23 01:40:04,1

"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! Paramount+ expect you to PAY for this lame content which they provide, & promise absolutely nothing in return, other than that you BETA-TEST their unfinished software for them... IMHO... we need less XYZ+ Apps, & a lot more money spent on MOVIES/TV SERIES going which end up being cancelled! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",2024-02-09 00:28:50,1
Why is there no 'continue watchong'? You have to start at the beginning everytime and skip forward and try and remember where you were. This is a major issue. Other than that the app is laid out like other streamers and works well.,2024-01-31 22:58:24,2

"Only 1 language available even when series or movies are definitely translated into French, German or Spanish. Disappointed and won't continue subscribing.",2024-02-08 01:06:56,1
Impossible to cancel. No clear instructions or info through which platform you signed up. Beware of free trials - you won't be able to unsubscribe easily. Pure scam in my opinion,2024-02-19 22:10:03,1
Lacks subtitles in major shows. Watching Halo and cannot see subtitles. The TV app is slow to load and scrolling is horrible.,2024-02-10 06:22:44,2
Decent streaming service with good content. App performs well on Android 14 now but unfortunately no 4k UHD unlike competition.,2024-03-28 10:47:18,3
Content is ok but the app is temperamental and often unusable. It's much easier to watch their content on dodgy online streaming services.,2024-02-20 22:56:37,2

Steer clear from this one.",2023-11-06 20:00:48,1

Too bad, cuz the content isn't half bad. Just can't watch it without issue after issue. Either they're customer service is awful, or they literally don't have the competence on staff to fix this.

The app itself was also slightly buggy when last used by my household.",2023-12-30 05:51:34,3

I wish it had profiles and had the ability to download. Also wish the skip or fast forward buttons were on the app too. Next could you fix the glitches one when it goes from a new season to go to the next season if there is one. Instead of automatically starting a new show all together. The other is a side thing I noticed when I was streaming through chrome cast; it doesn't recognize the episode. So when it is done it skips the next like 3 and plays them not in order. Also is there no way for the app to keep what you are watching up to date. Not remove it from the continue watching. Or remove it but keep the show current for users when selected. That is actually the most annoying part of the app!!!!!😡😡😡😡",2018-11-24 06:12:19,3

The same with series, it doesn't even tell which episodes you watched. The content is good for 2 months after that, there's nothing worth watching. There's a few bugs now and then, subtitles don't sync in some movies. A bit disappointing...",2023-10-25 16:40:31,2
"The selection is good. Still kind of small, compared to other streaming services, but good. The problem lies in the servers I'm guessing. Whether on the app, my tv or on my PC, it never remembers where I was in a series. It saves some random point and never updates itself. Also having trouble with listings in general. I very often get errors when trying to even view info on a show. The episodes will be missing with a message saying ""No data available"". I have gigabit internet.",2023-10-13 10:58:49,3
"extremely underdeveloped app. if there are apps running in background it's basically game over, it's slow, doesn't load and hangs the whole time. search engine is ridiculous (useless): it doesn't show the titles that are definitely there, so you have to manually search the home page. also no cast and crew listed, so you can't use those to filter titles. subtitles are either slow or non existent. it shows errors almost all the time. the lack of original titles is just disappointing for the price",2023-03-31 08:10:37,1
"Just paid for a subscription and it keeps showing error message. The only options are retry (for connecting to a smart device) and cancel. Then you hit retry it continues to give the the two options. If you hit cancel it exits you out of the app entirely. Went to the support page and try restarting the wifi, Uninstalleling and reinstalling the app. Still no luck. Literally useless to subscribe when you cannot access any of the content at all.",2023-04-23 20:15:19,1
"The selection is good, the app works ok, but has several problems: 1) Casting often fails, where the TV starts showing the Paramount app but the video plays on my phone. It requires toggling it on and off. 2) If you try to rewatch an episode, you need to choose the episode before it, since it starts from where you last were, which is the end of the episode - and then autoplays the next (from the beginning). 3) Close captioning settings need to be set each cast session.",2023-04-23 00:56:57,4
"I like this App and service, and want to continue to like it, maybe even love it - but its not going to happen anytime soon. On Chromebook, mobile and even trying to cast it, the program or sport I am trying to watch is constantly refreshing or buffering, the images for shows rarely load in the main or subsequent menus and basic conveniences that we all have come to enjoy from the likes of Netflix and others arent even an option. Cannot skip start of shows or link into the next episode. PLS Fix!",2022-10-22 06:00:32,2
"I love the service and the content, and the deal you've done with Sky meaning we get it for free with their cinema package, and the app works well enough despite the odd glitch on my Sky Q box. But guys, the Android app is beyond hopeless. Not once have I been able to pick up my tablet after getting in bed and actually stream anything without having to completely reboot it. ""Need additional help?"" No, I just need the app to bloody work!",2022-07-05 23:36:08,1
"So, I like some of the content. It does have a few decent shows to watch. However, I have only watched 3 different shows and they all had some sort of bug. I watch on my Roku. Two of the shows, the audio and video were not syncing up. The other show had all sorts of issues. Some of the episodes had no audio at all, and then most of the episodes just jumped to the end of the episode. They definitely need to work on the glitches, I have used free streaming apps that were far better quality.",2021-09-14 16:56:18,2
"Very finicky app. When it does successfully open (maybe once every fifteen times), the picture quality is excellent but; No skip recap or introduction which I believe every other app has. Only way I've found to make it work, is search paramount on google, sign in and usually you will get to see your show. 50% of the time you may have to sign out and back I for the next eposode. Good buffering and good picture quality. I'll give them a few more months before I put the pirate hat on my convince",2022-12-15 02:23:48,2
"I find the app only works half the time which is quite frustrating as I pay a monthly fee. There are lots of shows I'd like to watch, but can't because the app does not work right. Ive tried hard shutdown, reinstalling, closong and reopening the app but nothing seems to make it work. I never have issues like this with Netflix. Please review your app and make it work more efficently. Thank you.",2019-01-30 03:36:35,2
"The selection is great but the app CONSTANTLY lags. It is almost impossible to watch a show. It goes down like every 2 minutes unless you are watching at like 3 am I will not be renewing after the free trial I will go back to streaming sites. I prefer to use paid apps because the quality is typically better, but not this one. I have no problems with any other apps (Stack TV, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, Netflix, Crave, Global, CTV etc.)",2020-03-23 00:32:10,2
"App seems very buggy. Downloaded some episodes and watched half of one earlier Returned to watch second half only to get error messages. Deleted the download and it streamed fine on 4G, but then I didn't want to pay for the data, that's why I downloaded it. Also, the app seems to forget where I've got to. Keeps starting from an earlier time or starting right from the beginning.",2022-07-22 17:09:31,2
"I just downloaded the app. I've never used the service before. I was interested in the TV shows they offered. There is NO way to create an account on the main page of the app, and the website auto-directs you straight back to the app front page with no options to create only to sign in. So far, the app is unusable until I uninstall the app and make the account then reinstall the app. It's not easy to use at all if I were anyone with little to no electronics experience. Stay clear of this app.",2022-12-30 03:18:26,1
"Worth trying, not enough content yet There's an ok number of things to watch (Top Gun), but I watched everything that was interesting to me before the trial was over, so I unsubscribed. Paramount mostly has reality shows, it's lacking blockbuster shows like Netflix's Stranger Things. Even after canceling the trial early it let me continue to use the service until the end date (thanks!), and there are coupons to get a longer free trial.",2023-02-04 14:02:48,4
I can tell this is a work in progress. My current pain points: - no skip intro button - crash every time my phone switches from 5g to WiFi - subtitles size setting applies to both phone screen and Chromecast with no way of configuring the two separately. I have to change this every time I switch. These problems are understandable in a relatively new app and I wouldn't mind them except that they've taken star trek from Netflix which has a much more mature and user friendly app 😐,2022-08-13 19:54:47,2
"Terrible. There's no ""continue watching"" option, so when you stop streaming you have to restart at the beginning of the film or series. There's no ""are you still watching"" so if you doze off you miss whole seasons as it's either stream the whole series back to back or start every episode individually. The subtitles are often spelled incorrectly, doubled up so you can't read them or out of sync with what's happening on screen. Uninstalled and subscription cancelled.",2022-07-05 16:33:34,1
"The content on this app is great and wide ranging. If this was just about the content(TV Shows, Movies, Sports etc.) It would be a five. However, because lamentabley some of the controls are difficult to use, the app often crashes for no apparent reason and the continue watching section is rarely up to date, it makes the experience annoying.",2023-10-25 23:39:57,4
"They have a lot of good movies and shows, but the app is pretty buggy. The subtitles are atrocious. They either play half off the screen or they are in the middle of the screen but out of sync. You'd think that would be a simple fix for them, and hopefully it is, but it's been a year and still on every different device I use there's the same issues. Also, why is it only Netflix that has a ""next"" button? I hate having to wait through all the credits in order to watch the next episode.",2023-08-21 02:28:22,3
"Third time re-rating this app and I am fed up. After installation and some watching, there was no ""continue watching"" option to pick up where I left off. Then, a few days later it miraculously appeared. Now it disappeared again. When I search the series I'm watching there is no indication there either of where I left off. Every other streaming app I use is trouble-free in this aspect - why is this one so troublesome. Should be a no-brainer.",2022-11-27 03:45:47,2
"Edit: app has definitely improved over the past months but could still be better. Doesn't always sync correctly with what episode you are up to, but now has picture in picture. Glitchy app, randomly closes, stops playing, doesn't start on the right episode if you switch to another app and back. Then poor features like no picture in picture function, search function doesn't bring up a match unless the title is perfect. Overall really poorly designed app that often doesn't work.",2023-10-11 23:43:37,3
"Will not cast from the phone to TV via an original Chromecast. Stuck with the Paramount+ logo on the TV and the ever spinning ""whirligig of no hope"" on my phone. It did work, for a while yesterday, but kept blanking out. I understand it may need a newer Chromecast to work properly. However Netflix, Amazon Prime, video The BBC iPlayer and Disney+ work flawlessly. Not particularly happy.",2022-06-24 19:33:44,2
"The app crashes constantly, at least 5 times per episode. It will say something about 'error the app requires wifi', and not load the episode. My wifi connection will be fine though and all my other apps will work, so its clearly the app. Very annoying. I will change my review if you fix this. It would be nice if you could download episodes like you can on the netflix app. Lastly, I love survivor, and it won't let me watch ponderosa episodes because I'm in Canada.",2019-08-29 23:40:06,1
"This app often won't load when you try to open it. I'm constantly getting an ""oops something went wrong please try later"" message. The selection of seasons/episodes are inconsistent. Some shows have all seasons. Some shows have big chunks of seasons missing, but randomly. They'll have seasons 1 and 2, but not 3 or 4, but they have 5 and 6 etc. Some seasons have all episodes, some seasons have one episode. Disappointing.",2021-07-31 13:31:14,2
"The worst streaming app ever, for god sake just copy whatever netflix is doing with their app. Here are the few problems; 1. App is super clunky, browsing through the app it takes it own sweet time to display the thumbnails for the shows and movies. 2. 99% of the phones have 21:9 screen ratio and the app doesnt support the resolution. You cant zoom the video and you are forced to watch into half the screen.",2021-12-05 07:04:21,1
"Very limited I won one month free for the service and I got to say, it doesn't worth your dime. The content list is very thin, the app functionality is very limited and if that wasn't enough the app itself is poorly programmed. You're not gonna find: skip intro, continue where you left off, recommendations, information, related series. All those very simple features most streaming services have this one does not, have some good series and some nostalgic stuff, but it ends there.",2022-03-29 19:44:07,2
"The navigation buttons/bar won't go away, play and pause commands from earbuds don't work. Audio distorts on some of the audio tracks. These problems have existed for a long long time. This app is just not up to par with Netflix, Disney Plus, YouTube... Even the Prime Video app works better that this app. It's probably time to invest in an overhaul. I'm using paramount plus less and less due to these issues, and it's a shame.",2023-10-30 01:20:13,1
"I would give 4 stars for the content. The app is a 2 stars - maybe even 1 star, but on cabled network it works fine. The ""My List"" should be easier and faster to access, not having to go through the layers of movies/series to get to it. On a Windows PC, using Edge (and eventually creating an app with Edge) works - or not. Trying to start a movie/episode will do just that. NOTHING, only a black screen. While on Google or Firefox it works fine. Other than that, no more comments.",2022-03-29 23:33:26,2
"The phone app has some issues that need sorting out. For starters, the app crashes 100% of the time on the main page when I scroll down past the first few categories. Secondly, when it gets to the credits of an episode, the app automatically takes you to the next episode. There doesn't seem to be any ""Watch Credits"" button. I can only stop it happening by shrinking the video by exiting the app. Annoying for end credit scenes & also if you want to see the credits.",2023-10-15 06:45:26,3
The app itself is of a very poor design. It lacks even more features than Disney+. 1. No skipping options. 2. No stop button ( pause only) No going back to main menu or to list of episodes while playing back ( you have to leave the app and turn it back on again to do that) I understand you just started but why can't you just make it functional like YouTube or something? Two stars to encourage improvements. All the best.,2022-06-24 16:30:12,2
"I haven't had a bad experience with using paramount + , it could be better but I just didn't use it that much. Now I come to cancel my subscription and the website tells me to go to the app, the app has no cancel button and directs you to the support page which tells you to go to the website which tells me to go to the app that won't let me unsubscribe. I try in the Google Chromecast TV to do it there but there is no option to cancel either. This is ridiculous! Support page is useless too!",2022-04-19 12:41:32,1
"Edit: Now lowered my rating to one star. On top of horrible functionality, it begs for rating. Content is decent but the app itself is horrible. It will NEVER remember which episode you came to and to find the right one you'll have to search the show rather than just open episodes from ""last seen"". Also, it will NEVER remember your language and subtitle settings, and said menu will be in different languages from time to time. It will often not play the next episode and at times it crashes.",2022-03-03 07:20:46,1
"It Could have a better interface, like when I click on the ""keep watching"" it could (and I dont mean to sound bias) be like netfkix where it takes you to an option of episode rather than straight to where you last was watching, because sometimes we fall asleep while watching and maybe need to go back an episode. So rather than typing in the search the show we are already watching, just have that option maybe?",2022-09-14 03:24:21,4
"Content is good, and there are some exciting things coming, but the app is quite primitive compared to the competition. The biggest issue for me, is there is no continue watching. I see this has been brought up in other reviews, and the response is ""use the my list feature"" however, this doesn't save my spot in the middle of an episode, or a movie like literally every other paid streaming service",2022-06-08 14:50:15,2
"I'm using the app via Chromecast. I don't seem to have the problems with crashing and buffering others have. So far all shows are playing fine. My beef is that there is no ""continue watching"" function. Even when I search for shows I have been previously watching there is nothing to indicate where I am up too. Fix this and it's a five star streaming app.",2022-03-25 00:53:49,2
"Pro: * it has some TV shows that aren't available on any other platform Cons: * app is very laggy/slow * when watching a TV series, the app doesn't always bookmark where you left off. Often I'll come back to a show that doesn't continue where I left off. * No option to see all genres/categories as a list so you can quickly select what you want. *No PiP (picture in picture) function. Unfortunately this app doesn't stand out from major streaming platforms.",2021-11-18 17:24:34,3
Sometimes I'll come back to a show and skips 1-2 episodes for no reason. Done this to every show I'm watching multiple times. Had some episodes ruined. App crashed a few times. Shows don't pause or skip from lock screen. It's hard to pick an episode or check where you are in a series. You have to manually search instead of just clicking information like other services. Have to swipe screen up to go back home as the home bar disappears. Lots of small bugs that makes the app mildly infuriating.,2021-08-29 07:33:15,1
"The app is awful. It doesn't remember anything I watch or how far I am through an episode since reinstalling after some months. It has remembered what I had watched previously, but this never changes! Unable to remove anything from the watch next list in the app. Issues with it crashing a lot. No way of marking something as watched manually. Very poor usability.",2023-08-11 19:12:41,1
Well this app is good and all but it takes a long time to load from rewinding and fast forwarding the movies and shows. Some times it kicks me out all together multiple times in a day. Aswell I have two tvs with this app and it keeps saying on my 1 TV that these programs do not play in your country!!!! IM IN CANADA!!! This is the exact location and internet where I signed up for this app. It's quite frustrating to have to mess with it for 5 minutes every time I'd like to switch rooms. 3 stars,2023-03-20 18:40:49,3
"I basically only got Paramount+ so I could watch America's Next Top Model since there are 0 streaming services available in Canada for me to watch this. Went to watch it today and it's just gone. Nonexistent. I will be canceling my subscription as there is nothing else on this app that is appealing to me. It ran smoothly on my phone. Always played episodes in the correct order. Never crashed. I would get the odd time the app just would not open and it would tell me there were ""errors"".",2021-07-30 21:47:50,3
"App isnt working. When i click on a profile it says ""Oh no! Something went wrong"" with a cancle or retry option. Retracing doesn't help because you keep getting the same screen.

Everyone sharing the profile on different devices are having the same problem.",2023-04-23 22:58:43,2
"Some good content but rather poor as an app. Crashes constantly. Tried reinstalling, but doesn't make a difference. It's pot luck if you can actually get into it. In response to Paramount's reply. I am using the latest version of the app and that is all the support website suggests. ""The Paramount+ app is crashing We update the Paramount+ app on a regular basis, so please make sure you have the latest version, as this could affect your ability to stream programming.""",2023-06-13 20:15:52,3

I also tried via 2 separate browsers and with a second email address to no avail. I further contacted support and received a generic response asking me to contact further departments. Not impressed at all and won't be back. I will stick with the industry leaders in streaming services (hint:it isn't paramount+). Best of luck if you do decide to give them a go👍",2022-12-27 12:20:48,1
"Absolutely brutal. Trying to get through 1883. Constant glitching and buffering makes me definitely not want to continue with my subscription. No issues with Netflix or Disney+. Amazon Firestick app doesn't even work at all. After signing in, the app just crashes. Hoping I can at least get through Season 1 of 1883 before my 7 days is up but at this rate it will take me a year.

"Are you doing okay financially? Can you not afford to pay your devs? I thought Prime Video was the bad one. No bluetooth headphone controlling. No quality options. No progress tracking on the website. I pressed the left arrow key and instead of 10 seconds, it went back 7 minutes. Why? How is this okay? All the issues I've had apparently have been issues for at least a year. Why are allowed to leave the house looking like this. Go back inside and change. You're making everyone else uncomfortable.",2023-08-16 04:46:27,1
"Glitchy and almost unusable. The app has a download feature. However the shows you downloaded previously try to stream over wifi or data, even when going through the download tab. The app will randomly crash (about once a day for me) when trying to open my downloads folder. Only fix is to uninstall and reinstall the app causing me to lose all my downloaded content. Contacted customer support and they couldn't even provide an effective work around. I had to read other reviews. Useless!!",2021-03-28 22:40:08,1
"I am happy with Good selection of shows, I used it almost every day since the app came out. I would've given it five stars if it wasn't for a couple of annoying things. The app signs me out randomly all the time so I have to keep signing back in, for some reason every time a start up a show I've been watching it starts playing from end of the episode I'm up to so then I have to play it again and rewind it also there's no button to take me to the home page of what I'm watching, have to look it up",2022-03-05 03:03:49,2

"Denmark Pros: Good content Cons: Terrible app (Casting from android phone). Subtitles on normal size are far to big, choose small amd they're far to small. Plus Subtitles appear on some shows in the middle of the picture - seriously amateur compared to other streaming services in Denmark.

Trying to watch the last season of Yellowstone, and it is taking me over an hour and a half to watch each episode because every 10 seconds, it stops for a couple seconds, then plays for 10 seconds, then stops.

Feels like an app in it's alpha stage. Subtitles are either way to large or small. They are not always centered horizontal and they are anchored to high up in the screen. This still needs fixing Some of the really bad bugs seems to be fixed but a new bad one is introduced. For about 2 weeks now the app won't keep track on the shows i watched or how far I am in an episode,2022-03-04 20:30:34,2

No 'continue watching'😲 - I need to dig through all the episodes to locate the right one and then manually skip to where I was... Also, I'm currently getting this free with some other service that I pay for. In its current state, I would not pay for this. Agreed, these are all first world problems 😅.

I have watched 5 seasons of CSI, but it keeps trying to return me to a Season 3 episode. And recently, the ""My List"" collection of earmarked shows and movies just vanished. What's the point of a personalized list if I can't access it? The user interface is so frustrating, if you fixed these SIMPLE issues, this would be a good app. As it is? I hate it.",2022-03-14 06:17:42,2

Also if i want to pause a movie and watch the remainder later on you have to remember where you stopped off and play from there.

"The content is good as I like Star Trek and some of the other Paramount Plus created shows. I'm just so annoyed by the fact that it doesn't remember any show or episode I watched. Ever since I subscribed the app both on my phone and tv doesn't place any partly watched show in the ""keep watching"" section or even records that I watched it. This means I have to remember the episode I last watched or worse have fast forward to where I previously got to if I stopped watching half way through.",2023-06-24 21:17:53,2
Good content but terrible platform. Awful to navigate. Doesn't keep track of where you're up to- doesn't even have a 'continue watching' section. You have to search up the program and figure out where you were up to. I can't log into my account on Fetch- old school method of having to type it all in with the remote and can't see password. I tried 3 times and gave up. You would think with so many streaming platforms it wouldn't be too hard to know what does and doesn't make for good usability.,2022-04-18 06:54:48,1

Dunno where? pretty sure I counted all the films at around 100+.... When your advert makes it out to be a huge theme park sized app, I was expecting a 1000 odd films. I'm guessing the US version has all the films though! As it is now, unsub after a month until it gets content.",2022-07-05 23:52:41,2
"Garbage! This is the only app that doesn't play on my Samsung S23. If I'm watching a series such as Blue Bloods, I have to restart my phone between EVERY episode. The help topics on the support page aren't useful because they tell me I should restart my router. Well, that isn't going to happen because my router is working fine. If you subscribe through Google Play, you have to cancel through Google Play. This app is a complete waste of time.",2023-05-21 13:56:37,1
"What a horrible experience. After my first payment cleared, the app immediately started to glitch and act up. Now im trying to watch a movie and it keeps telling me your experiencing technical difficulties. Your support section on the site/app absolutely sucks. The app has no feature to skip to the next episode. One of the worst experiences ive had in a long time with a streaming app. Absolutely pathetic. Ive even uninstalled, reinstalled, clear cache in storage and still, WORST APP EVER!!!!",2023-06-18 15:47:10,1
"It's 2022, how do you release an application into production with minimal viability. Playback is non existent, constant crashes and errors, only available on mobile devices and TVs that run Android. How has this not yet been made available across various platforms to download?! How hard is it in this year to develop an application with the basic fundamentals (basic user friendly UI, video playback from where you left of and available across all Smart TV platforms). It's not rocket science.",2022-05-06 11:11:04,1
"Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but this app is very bad for watching serialized programming. Even if you just watch a single program, if you don't finish, the app will forget where you were and you will have to scrub around to find where to resume from. I use many video streaming apps and this seems pretty basic, which is why I can't imagine that this feature isn't included. Content is fine but usability is very poor, hence 3 stars.",2023-07-29 17:13:49,3
"Good content, bad execution. No ability to continue with what you are watching. No 'continue watching' section. When you go into a show and go back you are taken back to the top of the screen, not back where you should be. Once these teething issues are fixed it will be great. But unacceptable for a streaming service to launch without basic features.",2023-08-08 22:00:48,2
"Clunky to use. Frequently need to crash it and reopen to get refreshed version of what matches are live/available. Lack of pause/rewind/watch live from beginning is unfathomable. Not even the most basic of bit rate or resolution information is viewable. Every time you watch a football match, which you know the coverage is going to be 2 h+, a full screen ""Are you still watching?"" box comes up toward the end of the match. Terrible rush job.",2022-02-10 08:30:12,2
"Half the time the content doesn't load ,the app it's self takes a very long time to open or it says too many devices streaming at one when I'm the only one on it. I have had issues consistently for the two months I've had it. Disappointing there is no contact via phone to speak to a representative so my issue could be resolved in a timely fashion. I guess I won't be watching paramount again this evening. Canceling for certain.",2022-10-05 01:03:07,3
"WORST APP EVER!!! I downloaded the app on my Android smart TV and every time I even pause a show and then go to resume it gives me a ""video isn't available in your country"" error...and yes, I turned on my location in the settings...so every single time that happens I have to force stop the app and the re-open it...VERY ANNOYING!!! I may have to cancel my membership if this keeps up. AN EXTREMELY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER!!!!",2021-03-09 22:20:27,1
"It's not the time to buy Paramount+! The mobile version, has so many glitches. On first blush it looks like your standard streaming platform. But once you use it, it's pretty awful. It's definitely in the infancy of its life. It constantly pushes you back to the home screen. Which makes using it on your TV or phone extremely annoying. I downloaded this app today, and I know I will not go forward with a subscription. The content is fine, but unorganized! TV version is hard to navigate selection.",2022-12-28 15:43:17,1
Not a lot of original content. That will hopefully change over time. The app just doesn't work well. Next episode doesn't work until the end of the credits. No way to skip show intros. Poor notification of what episodes have been watched. Sometimes it will stop part way through an episode & skip to the next. Just not well thought out & buggy.,2022-03-17 00:24:01,2
"Needs a mini player on Android so you can access other things on your phone without having to stop viewing. Like people said, it can go to random parts/EPs of a program when resuming. It won't let you see the list of eps or seasons when resuming, you have to manually type in the program to find it. Could do with more of a description of movie or EPs. Overall the content is enjoyable and has a good range of programs. It was good to have south park specials fast track to my cousin with this app.",2022-01-07 14:49:46,3
"I want to like this app, but its lack of functionality makes that difficult. I like some of the content, but it randomly won't cast to my TV for specific episodes, other episodes that do cast will have the descriptive video on and no way to turn it off. When casting does work autoplay will skip over multiple episodes in the series. Other times it pauses every 10 seconds. I used to find deleting the app and reinstalling it every couple of weeks helped, but now even that isn't a solution.",2019-08-21 15:55:33,2
"I have been unable to contact Paramount Plus by phone, email, Instagram, so now trying the app. Just really really poor service. If something goes wrong you are absolutely stuffed. I see in the comments section that you are advised to contact customer support. I've tried, it doesn't work. You pick your selections, type up your complaint and it won't press send. The website doesn't work.",2022-05-12 04:00:32,1
"I like some of the shows, though it's a pretty limited catalogue. I did like that all the shows I had watched were captioned (though they sometimes and cut out) but was really annoyed when the one show suddenly stopped being captioned halfway through season 2! All shows should be captioned, accurately and without glitches, all the time! It's not a difficult concept!",2022-01-10 05:38:06,3
"I love the shows and the app except for the glitches. Even when shows are downloaded it will pause and try an load then continue on, but the words won't match the mouth movements. This will happen at least 5 or 6 times until you close the app reopen it, then have to skip ahead in the show to where you left off an hope it doesn't happen again. Would have rated higher but it seems like it needs a few more tune ups.",2022-10-04 09:23:50,2
"Not all content you'd expect is there, even shows produced for Paramount are sometimes several seasons behind. The app is slow, because every action requires some very slow calls to a server, and wait until everything is rendered. Search is very unpleasant because of that. You click on search, wait before you can type anything, in the middle of the typing the cursor goes back to the beginning, messing up your search term, and when you go back, it fetches everything again.",2023-02-04 09:56:59,2
"If you kind find what you're looking for hats off to you. I'd say they have decent stuff, but this app is not ready yet The state of this app would have been acceptable years ago. But we have progressed in the same apps at such a rate there is no excuse for the clunky, slow load, poor button placements and lack of general/basic features. You cannot search an actor or genre and get results. You might get one if you're lucky. They need a better UX team. Or to hire one in the first place.",2022-08-14 05:47:56,1
"This app decides when it wants to work. Most of the time it won't even open and says it's not responding. Other times, it won't connect to my chromecast. I've uninstalled the app COUNTLESS times and reinstalled it and it still doesn't work. Even RIGHT NOW it's not working and I PAY for it. I just want to watch Survivor. Super frustrating app. If you don't need it, DON'T GET IT. I need Survivor 😫 lmao",2021-02-28 19:24:36,1
"Content is great, however, once I download shows I cannot access them to watch. The app shuts down before I can pick and episode which is horribly inconvenient. The functionality of this app is horrible. Downloads cannot be viewed let alone watched. The app crashes frequently. It is absolutely awful. I could not be any more frustrated with this app and I would delete it if I didn't like the content. That is the only thing saving this app.",2021-05-07 16:31:43,1
"Honestly I just pay for survivor, I appreciate all the little fixes that are done to try and enhance our experience, but it's very frustrating not being able to go on the internet for basically like 3 months just so I don't get spoilers, cause the episode comes out a FULL WEEK after it aired. Thankyou for fixing Chromecast comparability, now I just need to be able to watch it when it comes out.",2019-09-30 03:16:15,3
"The app is serviceable, but not having separate users is a bit of an oversight. Even Foxtel's binge has that feature, and that's a company that was stuck in the Stone Age for years. There is also too many things missing from your back catalogue, and because of that I can't fully recommend this service. I signed up because I thought there would a lot of shows that would scratch a nostalgic itch, but it definitely fell short. It now constantly signs out on Android tv.",2021-09-29 08:30:00,1
The app works. I can even cast to my Google tv. Improvements I would like is the option to skip intro of TV shows. Like most of us I watch a few episodes in a row and have to manually skip intro every time. Music seems louder than actors voice and I'm constantly having to turn sound up and down. Picture quality is very good and there is no buffering. Monthly subscription is on par with other streaming services I rate this app 7/10. This is due to the device or programme.,2022-08-10 06:57:22,3
This app will not let me turn off descriptive audio when using Chromecast for the show Why Women Kill and it is incredibly annoying. It let me turn it off for one episode and now it's stuck back on and no amount of trying to adjust the audio in-app has any effect. I even uninstalled and reinstalled it. Absolute garbage. Please dont give me the customer service number and instead just test and fix this problem. Thanks.,2020-01-06 23:44:16,1
"Only available on my phone and have to cast it. Add support for native TV apps and Xbox in the future! The video quality leaves more to be desired. No download function for most content. Then ""downloadable"" shows, ie, South park, don't actually download. The whole app is a glitchy mess. Trying to find where I left off in the progress bar at the bottom of the screen shows preview images of the last piece of content I watched. They make it very difficult to cancel your subscription too. Just don't",2022-12-25 20:45:59,1
"Stops working after I watch a few+ hrs of shows then the video skips, pauses, buffers. It does it EVERY NIGHT. I try rebooting, nothing. I check other apps, they're running fine; it's not my internet. I wait for 30 mins and the video is still poor. I try other shows on Paramount and it still sucks. It's like they don't want me to watch Paramount anytime after 930pm pt. Am I watching too much of your TV shows. I have the same experience with Amazon firestick. So frustrating.",2021-05-25 04:39:55,1
"Lots of little issues that just ruin the experience. Some content doesn't stretch to the width or height of the phone screen leaving unused black space all around the video. Cant resize video to fill screen. Weirdly, the brightness is low on most content even after maxing out my phones brightness????. Menu can be very slow and bug out. I have an s22 ultra and none of these technical issues are present in other video platforms in youtube, Netflix and Disney. I paid 5$ and I was still let down",2022-07-30 10:24:16,2
"Totally unreliable. Not the app to binge Tv shows, constantly crashes midway or when an episode finishes, sometimes won't play next episode, crashes. Often says, sorry something went wrong, also when you try to watch where where you left off. Yet other shows, movies are working. Also can have entire app crash. No matter how many times you reset, you're stuck waiting, end up going to another app.",2022-02-16 17:02:02,1
"Only downside is that it doesn't always resume from my previous spot in the show that I was watching. For example it asks me to resume ""Survivor Season 13 Episode 5"" when I am actually on ""Survivor Season 14 Episode 9"". If they could add a feature to clear your ""continue watching"" cue I'm sure this would fix the problem. Otherwise I love the new look and feel of the app, it's much more user friendly than previous versions.",2020-04-12 17:05:38,5
"False advertising, yes the app has some great ""T.V."" content and works well on my device. But when they advertise ""Blockbuster Movies"" I expect there to be some movies. There are none. Usually something like this wouldn't bother me but this is a premium app which I paid for. So if you're looking for movies keep looking. I won't be resubscribing unless the content is changed.",2021-05-26 15:00:25,2
"When I'm watching a TV show, the episodes play in a random order it's so annoying! I've no idea this is happening until it starts repeating itself, then I have to manually go in and select the correct one. For some reason for this TV show the same episodes appear twice. But they are numbered differently which is really strange. Also I wish the option to see all episodes was available when currently watching, otherwise you have to open the main menu, type in the show, find the season/episode etc.",2023-02-22 07:18:17,3
It is functional but it badly needs to keep track of what has already been watched and let the user restart from where they stopped off. At the moment every time I select a series it assumes I want to start watching at the beginning of episode 1 of series 1. This is annoying even when I remember the last thing I watched. It's intolerable when I can't.,2022-06-29 19:49:16,3
"This is the first app I've ever taken the time to review. The casting capabilities of the application are absolutely and inexcusably horrible. I've tried with multiple phones, computers, tvs, chromecasts, networks, etc., and have yet to achieve reliable casting. This issue has existed within the app for months without resolution. In the crowded streaming-service space, one would think CBS would attempt to create a usable application.",2019-07-29 13:13:24,1
"It's a good app, however they need to update the UI with features that give more control and help the user. There should be a button that shows you all the episodes and seasons while you're in the player, so there's no need to leave and and re open the player. Subtitles should be customizable. I hate subtitles with a black bar behind them. These prevent me on small screens from seeing what's going on, and can sometimes block important things within the frame.",2023-03-05 12:03:38,3
"Please fix this app..it does not keep track of eposides that have been seen from the continue watching menu, so I do a search to access the list of eposides and then the search displays no results. So no one's going to go back to season 1 episode 6) for example) then fast forward to season 3..will cancel subscription if this isn't resolved soon.",2022-07-26 00:44:35,1
The app does not allow you to access it without internet. This makes downloading movies for a flight completely useless. Also the audio from other apps will play in the background. If spotify is on the music will play while watching a video. You need to close paramount and stop spotify and open paramount again. If I'm watching a downloaded show it does not auto move onto the next show I have downloaded it will use my data and play it not the downloaded version.,2022-08-19 00:18:43,1
"Incredible!! this app can't use with fire tv. Wake up! We're in XXII century. I did exactly what you indicated me and it doesn't work yet.

This is the message since February and you haven't fixed.",2022-08-10 02:00:01,1
"Very good. Still a little buggy. Listed below 1. If I press the space bar on my tablet connected keyboard the screen seems to gain a white opaque colour over the content. 2. The native navigation bars don't naturally dissapear when content is playing have to tap in the viewer when content is playing to make these appear. 3. Probably early in the life cycle of the app, but sometimes I don't want to watch the full intro sequence. When app is updated then that feature could be enabled.",2022-08-03 09:50:14,4
"The app seems to work ok. My problem is that I have been trying to cancel my subscription for days, but it seems to be impossible to do this. After spending hours trying to cancel my subscription, I emailed customer support but have not received any reply. I guess they use a business model that wants to make cancelling subscriptions difficult (the app allows you to upgrade your subscription!). But once I cancel my subscript I won't go back to Paramount, now. So they lose out in the end.",2023-06-25 02:57:31,1
"When this app actually works it's great, but more than not when I go on to watch a show I click on the title and then there are absolutely no episodes. NONE!!!! It's done this on more than one occasion. And secondly when I actually do get to click on a show half the time it won't play, it keeps saying to check internet connection. I watch on my tablet and phone, I know there isn't anything wrong with my WiFi...i can watch YouTube and other video apps just fine.",2018-11-18 09:57:58,2
"Due to the lack of an app on PlayStation 4 systems I've had to make do with this mobile app and the Chromecast and it's a terrible experience. When the app buffers on an episode (which happens often for me), after a while it'll give up and skip the episode you're trying to watch, which irritates me to no end, sometimes even playing a random episode too, forcing me to stop casting and recast the app to my Chromecast. Even while I've had episodes paused, it'll skip to the next episode at random.",2022-11-19 16:52:51,2
"Takes all the bandwidth. I only have about 5mbps download, and there can be 2 Netflix shows, crave, and prime all running simultaneously with no issues, even possible to scroll Facebook or YouTube and no streaming interruptions. Paramount has to be the only thing running. I don't know if it's a tiny buffer or huge bandwidth requirement, but as soon as anything else is running an update or someone on a device starts streaming video of any kind, the Paramount stream starts lagging, then freezes.",2021-11-12 17:38:20,1
"Very buggy. When I'm watching a series, the app will randomly skip several episodes for no reason. It does it every time I watch more than two episodes in a row. There isn't a skip episode or previous episode button, only a skip forward 10 seconds. There is no option to skip the intro either. I understand it's a budget streaming service, but there are hundreds of reviews like mine! Fix your app!!!",2022-01-11 10:27:56,1
"I was disappointed all the old Paramount movies aren't available to watch, but there are some great shows. I LOVE The first ladies. However, I was lead to believe Scream was on here, but can't find it. Also, the functionality isn't as good as other streaming services, such as you can't navigate the episodes from the continue watching area and many shows don't have information about them listed or what is there doesn't tell you much.",2022-05-28 00:45:27,3
"as of today, there are no longer seasons. all the episodes are mixed together. episode 1 from every season is listed first then episode 2 from every season, and so on. I'd give zero stars if that was an option. it's extremely basic. no way to save anything to a watch list. shows just keep playing, there is no cut off or asking if you're still watching. the content isn't that great. the playback from the notification menu just doesn't exist, can only exit. just all around terrible so far.",2021-07-07 02:19:33,1
"A lot of childhood shows that I get to rewatch for the nostalgia, but the loading times are awful. Way too many times a show will freeze and I get a message saying 'an error has occurred'. Then I have to restart the show and it's about 10 seconds behind again. Update: Can't even watch anything on the mobile app anymore. Everytime I click into a show it says I need an internet connection to watch. I have a great connection but still can't watch anything. Don't recommended this app.",2022-09-13 09:12:49,1
"If you have to pause a show or movie to come back to later, you need to know the time you paused because it restarts everything. You can't see a preview of what your fast forwarding or rewinding either. I know it's just launched but this platform has had a year in America to get things right and other apps have managed to do better from launch. These might be small problems but they are really annoying. Once fixed, this is going to be a pretty cool streaming service.",2022-06-24 15:54:31,2
"It is a good app, except each episode, not with each watch session, I have to put closed captions on. It is frustrating that I cannot simply watch through 2 or 3 episodes of a show without missing the beginning and having to start over because I missed the first few lines of dialog putting the closed captions back on. Please change the app so people that are hearing impaired do not have to adjust the setting each time they want to watch something",2022-12-19 03:47:06,2
"Was working on my Samsung TV, then just stopped. It will open, I can pick a program and pick an episode but that's it. I get a message stating there's a problem and to try again later. Been trying again later for 2 days. The only app on my tv that I can't use. Signed up for a year, so I guess I'm stuck with it. Contacted customer service, no response.",2022-12-04 17:24:22,2
"It would be nice if there is ""view full screen"" option in the next update as it would give better viewing experience for subscriber who have big screen size phone like me who like to watch series on the phone. I've also installed the app on my Samsung TV and there is a huge delay in response when the forward, rewind or play were inputs. Otherwise, it has loads of good collections of movies and series.",2022-07-26 17:51:05,3
"The selection is great but that app not so much. Auto play doesn't work despite having the option selected. If I have subtitles selected, it only applies for the episode I'm on and only while I'm using it. If I exit the app I have to turn them back on. I constantly have to turn them on. There is sometimes a bit of a audio delay lag. It's barely noticeable but it is there sometimes. Whenever I watch stuff with the audio through Bluetooth the lag is even worse.",2023-05-31 21:43:35,2
Good app. Love the show selections especially the earlier ones. Only issue is it buffers a lot with my internet signal in the bedroom where I have other apps who work perfectly on my phone even on crappy internet service. Was watching an episode of MacGyver and it stopped and buffered about 10 to 15 times during the episode. You just start getting into the show and it's buffering again.,2020-08-20 02:24:31,3
"For such a large company that makes movies and TV series, one would anticipate that they could design a half decent application. I am sadly mistaken. No continuation from previous point. No ability while watching to simply return to main menu. No ability to continue watching in small window while going to different apps. The list goes on!!! Good thing the price point makes sense.",2022-05-15 02:54:13,2
"The content is okay, I appreciate having access to literally every season of a show, but the app isn't very good, it doesn't keep your place in the episode, or remember the last episode you watched (as examples), and theres no ""continue watching"" list. So yes, the content is worthwhile, but the app needs some real work. In reference to the reply from the developer: I appreciate that their is a ""my list"" but it doesn't really address the bigger issue of paramount have no memory of progress.",2022-04-12 01:06:34,2
"Terrible for watching the soccer. No ability to watch game from start, live only. No ability to pause, rewind or, if you start late, go back and see the goals. Check out the Kayo app. To see how it should be done. They even time stamp major game events so you can go back and see them. You'd think paramount would have a better budget to get something like this right.",2021-11-20 11:50:58,1
Has ok range of shows but after watching the few things I want I'll be cancelling. Its a disaster! Half the time it wont even open. You download content for later & it bugs out after about 20 minutes so much you have to close the app & then it won't open again. Feeezes constantly. Slow to load. Doesn't keep your place. Can't choose what episode to watch. Subtitles don't work properly. EDIT: It is so hard to cancel your subscription! They just keep giving you the run-around.,2022-10-13 03:53:16,1
"It started off great but I'm having an issue where it says I can have 3 devices run simultaneously but if I have only 1 screen running and nothing else it won't go to the next episode because it's running the max amount of screens, is their going to be an update to fix this issue?

"Picture becomes washed out and almost white if you have interaction with the screen or keyboard during playback. That means pausing, rewinding or forwarding is not really an option. The only way to return oicture to normal is to stop and restart whatever you're watching.

"April 2023, it's a little bit better, but still sucks. Loads content extremely slow and unfriendly interface compared to other similar apps. So I haven't checked out the library, because it takes too long to load. Only use it for EPL and featured series. This goes for both android and Samsung tv apps. App also has too few options in settings. Worst of all the streaming apps so far.",2023-04-11 12:20:51,2
"A decent selection, great quality video, and is in english. They have about all the features of other streaming apps. The price is also ok. I recommend the skip to the next episode pop up to come up faster or to be in a hidden menu when you touch the screen. Paramount Plus is a streaming app worth keeping around but still has room to grow. To be clear, Paramount plus is great and i definitely recommend it.",2023-08-02 19:07:40,4
"I keep getting error messages when other similar apps work fine, so it's not my internet. If I watch on different devices, it doesn't start from where I left off on the other device.

Like the shows, hate the app.",2022-09-24 21:26:02,1
The lineup of content is OK but the most annoying this is the lack of synchronization across devices. You download something on your phone and want to carry on watching on TV but instead of picking up where you left off like every other streaming service you have to start from the start and find where you left off. Nothing syncs! The (fast) forward and rewind are terribly slow too. fix these and it would be a decent app. It feels like the devs never looked at what their competitors do.,2022-10-31 15:57:49,3
"This app doesn't start sometimes, just show the blue loading screen. After 3+ times trying then I give up. Video doesn't take advantage of the screen area, uses about 80-85%.

"I got this specifically for the A League, and was so disappointed, I cancelled my subscription half way through the season. I can watch any show without any buffering interruptions, but watching the football was a nightmare. Constant buffering, skipping ahead, and stopping the stream with a ridiculous error message saying that 'the video can't be played at the moment'. I suspect they've underestimated how popular the football is and their servers can't keep up with demand.",2022-02-28 07:07:03,1
"Edited after a few weeks use: it's working well! Loads of technical issues on sign up, but they've resolved now and it's good.

App doesn't crash on TV or phone, user-friendly, and fast loading.",2022-08-01 20:59:08,4
"What was a frustrating app has become unusable. Previously I had to regularly delete the app and then reinstall to get it to work. Now I can't log-in OR reset the password; it's become completely inaccessible. When I try to reset the password, nothing happens—no email arrives in my inbox in order to reset, so it's just taking up space on my phone and serving no function. Zero stars, would not recommend.",2023-09-27 02:14:15,2
"Good range of content. The interface is well laid out (much like Netflix) and reasonably intuative, but would benefit from basic functions such as skip intro, skip to next episode (who reads the credits??!). It's biggest flaw however is it is so buggy on Android and via Sky Glass. On a daily basis the app buffers dispite perfect connection, freezes and often fails to load at all.",2022-09-11 00:24:35,3
"I could give a great review if the App would work every day. I like the content but at least once a week the content is not available with the following message on my Smart TV: ""Uh-oh. An error has occurred, but we're working on fixing it. We'll be up and running again shortly! On my phone, the App directs me to downloading it again and keeps spinning with no successful download. Extremely annoying!",2023-02-24 21:07:41,3
There is no option to choose the season or episode for each show. This is a basic function available on all of the competitors. The app doesn't remember the last episode watched. I must use Chromecast to watch this service on my TV. There is no LG smart TV app. The content is very good and there are quite a few different movies and series not available on other services.,2022-10-01 23:39:30,4
"Good selection of shows, but the app could use some work. I was watching SpongeBob and the subtitles were very mis-timed. They were around 3-4 seconds ahead of the actual dialogue. Also after setting subtitles and tapping on the screen to continue watching, once you tap again the settings icon disappears so your only option is to exit the app and go back into it. Could be great, just needs some work.",2021-09-16 09:51:02,3
"Good content and good UI, however the thing that let's this app down and makes it unusable, is the fact that any film or TV show that has the black letterbox bars are not able to be zoomed to fit the phone screen. I have a Samsung Galaxy S21 Utlra, when watching I lose half the screen to a black box around the picture. All the other streaming apps allow you to zoom in to remove the black bars and take advantage of larger screen sizes. You would think this would have been included.",2022-06-25 20:01:39,1
"I created an account through my Sky TV. All good untill I press on any of the.movies or shows. It starts loading but never finishes. The app freezes and in order to get out of it I have to press the home screen, which brings me back to sky. Never had such an issues with any other movie/TV show app. Sky customers are offered the free subscription of Paramount but it would have been nice offer if it actually worked.",2022-07-01 01:37:14,1
"Paramount has some great content. Unfortunately this app is terrible. The functionality is very limited compared to other streaming apps, the app runs crazy slow and often breaks down. It's so frustrating to use that I've gone back to using the website instead via my browser. The website also has some problems, but still much better than this app.",2022-01-04 13:40:49,1
"I do like the app, but there are things that would be good to address: 1. It would be good to be able to have a, ""skip intro"" function to cut past the beginning credits etc. 2. There are times when using the subtitles that English which is my language of choice for subtitles isn't consistently available for all episodes in the same series. 3. The autoplay function moving on to the next episode in a series doesn't always go to the next episode, there are times that it goes to a previous episode",2022-07-09 10:11:56,4
"This app crashes constantly, it won't stream to Chromecast most of the time! It will play maybe 5 or 6 episodes of a show then will stop and when you try to select another show you were trying to watch it will not cast to Chromecast! But when you choose a show that you have not watched yet, then it will work! There is nothing wrong with my internet connection or with my Chromecast device! You need to revamp the coding and the algorithms! Streaming apps need to be updated at least once a month!",2019-10-22 15:08:44,1
"The worst streaming app EVER. When I start to watch a movie or series it just won't appear on my 'continue watching'. when i finish a movie it just gets stuck like I haven't finished it. app doesn't always launch, it opens when it feels like it. It is not user friendly. And the catalog it's just not that great. THE WORST. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL.",2023-04-06 20:21:57,1
"Definitely has a ways to go to be able to compete with other streaming services. Exclusive content doesn't mean much when your app freezes every time I press the Rewind 30 seconds button. As others have said, this app is extremely bare bones, and has barely a fraction of the features of other services e.g. no subtitle opacity controls, video speed controls, no built in brightness/sound controls, no skip intro button, no skip episode button. I will be canceling my subscription.",2022-01-08 02:08:59,2
"The app is very basic, slow to load and there are no controls for screen size. I have a pixel 6 pro with a massive 6+inch screen and the app forces playback at 5inches and it can't be adjusted even through the web interface. Also you cannot start streaming sport from start or pause the game while live and it takes hours for a playback to be available after the game is complete. This is very poor for a modern streaming service.",2022-03-31 18:56:45,1
"I kept hearing they were supposed to release a whole bunch of content but have not seen anything yet. I've cancelled my subscription. Not going to pay for an empty library. I might return in month to see if things have changed. Also, I am not sure who there UX/UI designer is but there Interface needs some work. No options to favorites anything or to place in a list. The design is very simplistic and bland. Needs a lot of work.",2021-07-14 22:59:07,1
"Content is great, but that's about it. It takes forever and a day to load (if it loads at all). I've tried using my smart tv, phone app, hubby's iPad...no luck. Also, there's no option to shut subtitles off until you launch an episode. Then you have to select subtitles off, exit the show, re-start the show. This has to be done every time I launch an episode. I would assume an incredible company like Paramount would have a better app, especially if they're charging people to stream off it.",2022-12-15 01:23:36,1
"Youd think months of complaints they would fix it by now. Great shows but the set up of the app is horrible. It will never save where I am up to. I have to search the movie and find where I was up to. Tv series are worse, it might save 2 episodes behind. Can't even do something simple every other streaming service can do...paramount is the worst. I'm cancelling unfortunately because I'm sick of trying to figure out where I was up to. Won't be recommending to friends and family.",2022-07-21 01:56:31,2
"FIX YOUR APP The playback is terrible... I cannot get through more than one episode without it glitching.... audio and video stop lining up, it pauses constantly.... and this is downloaded content, so no internet issues! App freezes and shuts down constantly. Very disappointing, as I downloaded to watch specific content, but I will need to cancel my subscription, as I just can't watch. I've seen tons of similar reviews.... fix your app!!!!",2022-09-24 01:30:46,1
"Some interesting content but the app is so badly designed! It lacks features that are really basic for any streaming service: 1. It doesn't have profiles! All users will get the same ""My list"" 2. You can't pause and then rewind 10 secs if you missed something because the app simply freezes! This happens consistently both in the android app and in the web browser in my laptop 3. Subtitles are not available in English for some shows. I mean, all they had to do was to copy what Netflix did...",2022-05-03 06:07:26,1
"I hate this service but because of the FA Cup had to try it again and disappointed once again. There is an issue where the movement of the camera as it follows the ball is jittery. It's not smooth, it's like little by little. It's not my internet connection as I tried on both Wi-Fi and without. And all other devices in the house are not having connection issues. How do they keep getting it so wrong?!: Update. Trying to watch the FA Cup final and the streaming is at 1.5x, the sound is terrible.",2022-05-14 17:40:46,1
This Is the worst streaming service out there. It's constantly glitching out. The cast feature is the absolute worst. Also doesn't give the option to start an episode over from the beginning. So when I try to go back to a previous episode it skips to the next consecutive one. This is the most frustrating app ever. I'm just trying to watch CSI dang it 😡,2022-09-29 17:55:39,1
"No so much an app rating, but for the Paramount+ platform overall. Streaming quality is fine. Content is ok, some nice shows in the mix. User experience is something overlooked when bringing to market, focusing more on looking good than functionality. No playback history/indicator (or feature not consistent), watchlists/reminders. Platform improvements needed, including Smart TV sign-in experience (e.g. App assisted sign-in).",2021-10-03 09:51:02,3
I love the price and the variety of shows. The app was working great until I connected to Google Chromecast. Now I can only watch shows using Chromecast. Whenever I try to watch shows on just my mobile device the app states that an internet connection is needed. There is nothing wrong with my internet connection. This is a little annoying.,2018-12-29 05:57:07,3
"I won a free 3 month subscription. I'm thankful it was free, because after the continuous issues and incredibly poor customer service - I will not be purchasing a subscription. None of the on demand TV series or movies can play. I have emailed customer service many times - they repeatedly ask the same questions over from previous emails I've already answered. Their last email said they updated the programming... for Roku. I was very clear and direct that I was streaming on Android device.",2021-11-04 12:54:11,1
"Decent movies/shows, terrible app. I (used to) watch south park everyday in P+, the player was half decent, it didn't save where I stopped in an episode and it always started from the beginning, that was annoying but manageable. Now, ""used to"" because now the app simply refuse to open. Even if I uninstall and install again, clear data, clear cache, restart my phone. Nothing. If nothing's done, it's gotta be one of the worst streaming apps so far",2023-04-26 15:20:44,2
"Consistent issues with audio where I'm getting background music only and can't hear the dialogue. I've tried all the ""fixes"" listed online and nothing is working. Super annoying to get into a series and then not be able to watch it because of this issue. I've restarted everything, cleared cache, forced stopped, and even Uninstalled and reinstalled. Nothing helps.",2021-10-04 16:13:32,1
"Honestly, probably the worst streaming service I have ever used. I hate it, but I'm forced to use it for the ALeague. The interface and search functions are terrible. On my ipad I cant see the Live Game options, but on my phone I can. The apps lag, and worst of all it's app is only compatible with a small handfull of TVs. There are consistent issues with the ALeague live streams. After a year I was hoping they would fix the issues but Paramount doesnt seem to care. 4 more years of this garbage.",2022-10-08 05:36:01,1
"No complaints about the content, but as others have pointed out, the app itself needs work. It's very buggy. The ""continue watching"" feature only works about 10% of the time, sometimes clicking on shows does nothing and the app has to be rebooted, buffering is frequent, etc. Not issues that customer support can address (if they could, there wouldn't be tons of negative reviews here with the same issues). The app needs to be fixed on the developer end. When will this happen?",2022-07-06 02:09:12,2
"While the content here is great, especially for the cost, the features are heavily lacking. No skip recap or skip intro. This surely should be standard. Poor syncing. Even on the same device. Eg quite often I will stop an episode, go to continue, and the app brings me back to a previous episode/ timestamp. No PIP or background play. No Bluetooth control. No control via Bluetooth devices ie play/pause/volume. I know this is new, but a comparison with the competition would have been a good idea.",2022-11-20 14:12:28,2
So I was trying you're app with an intent to keep it but honestly I'm not going to after the 30 days. It kinda sucks. I use it almost exclusively with Chromecast and if u watch 1 episode of a show it doesn't play the next. It skips through and plays later random episodes! And is there a list button where I can save shows I want to come back to later?? Disappointed.,2018-12-10 19:59:35,2
"The app needs a lot of work. Even though I've watched an entire series, it still appears in the keep watching list. There is no easy removal from the keep watching list despite the instructions in the Help section. The option doesn't even exist. Unless you search for something specific the list under each category doesn't show that particular show or movie. I watched one standup comedy special and that's all that's listed in MOVIES recommended for me.",2022-07-29 23:34:07,3
"Very little content. About 200 different movies or shows but 80%+ of it is either reality tv, kids tv or documentaries. Doesn't come remotely close to Amazon prime/ Netflix etc. No support for xbox, smart tv etc. The Chromecast button doesn't even work on the app. It's just greyed out so you can literally only watch it on your phone or laptop. I cancelled about 15 minutes after I signed up even though I had a 7 day free trial. It's a shame because I was rooting for you.",2022-06-22 20:07:27,1
"This app is so unstable it's ridiculous. It will freeze, crash, then won't open, then get stuck on the load screen, then when you do get get in it will just error out. I shouldn't have to reboot my devices to use this app! I spent a half hour last night trying to watch the end of the Yellowstone premiere after I went and did something else for half an hour. It wouldn't load no matter what I did. Considering you guys had the balls to double the price recently, spend some on fixing the app!",2022-11-15 03:42:01,1
"The clunky UI needs streamlined, it's missing many basic features you'd expect from a streaming site that wants to compete. Also what's the point of downloading episodes for offline if the app doesn't even open without an Internet connection? The one plus is that it is priced under £10 and I honestly don't think the service will succeed if the price goes up considering the state the app is currently in. You can also use the fast forward button to REWIND the show if you're too close to the end??",2022-08-22 10:06:26,2
"The app seems to be glitchy, often failing to load things correctly. It also fails to keep track of where you're up to in a show, meaning it's often a few episodes behind with no easy way of selecting the specific episode you want in the dashboard. No way to play outside of the app like in Stan either. Paramount also has a pretty limited range of shows compared to stan or Netflix. If you're tossing up and don't have one of those I'd recommend them over Paramount+.",2022-06-29 04:42:23,2
"Good entertainment content that is growing. But the app is very poor. No profiles for the Australia version. Very clunky and slow. Doesn't have a lot of features its competitors have, so behind in user experience. Don't expect a full experience on sports streaming either (woke up at 2am for the FA Cup final and couldn't end seeing the whole trophy presentation as they just cut it).",2022-05-14 21:46:42,2
"Constantly have to close and restart on my TV, especially when switching profiles. Can't view full screen on my phone, and always has the tasks/home/back buttons over the picture.😡 Galaxy s21, and androidTV. Update: I went to the support page, couldn't, get an answer to the problems. Our other streaming services work fine on our TV.",2023-04-10 21:34:36,1
"The shows are not in question. The app however lacks many features and is temperamental. Example it keeps ""forgetting"" the series I'm currently watching so that I have to search and find where I'm at in the episodes. It also won't keep CC turned on. Finally the sound quality is uneven among episodes of the same series and season. A good example is CSI that has most episodes in Dolby surround but the app throws them out in stereo for no apparent reason using the same equipment. Do better please.",2020-12-16 21:01:51,3
Overall this is average the app has one major flaw. Unlike most other streaming apps this one does not track which episodes you have already watched or save your progress during an episode for you to go back to. Consequently you have to spend some time scrolling and watching episodes till you find where you left off. Mainly for this to access star trek.. thankfully new series is much better than discovery...only hope content improves and functionality. Or this will be a one off subscription,2022-07-08 16:35:39,3
"I'm enjoying this app in addition to my new Chromecast as I can watch shows on my older TV. The app takes away the 10 sec rewind/ffwd when casting so that's odd. The desktop version always minimises the full screen in between episodes and is annoying, so I prefer to cast from the app. I finally get to watch some older shows and movies that I didn't see enough of with antiquated, expensive cable, so that's another plus. After the few kinks are worked out, it will be pretty much as good as Netfli",2020-03-11 19:36:37,4
"App constantly crashes or stops playing what your watching with an error code, will start ""auto playing"" a new movie or show after you've finished but all you can see is the home page where you scroll through their selection while you van hear the audio playing, after finishing the last episode of a season it will auto replay that episode, app definitely needs improvement, movie & show selection is basic, not worth the money, only have it for three movies free thanks to McDonald's.",2023-01-14 23:22:21,2
"This must be the least intuitive interface for an app that I have ever used, the fact that they ask us to pay for it is awful, can never actually use the app to watch anything, even if you do manage to find something. Have not managed to successfully stream a single tv program from the library, sometimes the live sport does work but the quality is so poor as to make it unwatchable. Had to try to support A-League but will discontinuing membership.",2022-07-30 21:43:23,1
"The app is missing some very well established User Interface design. For example, no skip intro button, no option to skip credits for next episode etc. I was also expecting a lot more older movies and TV. Paramount has been producing TV and film for years, I was expecting to see more of that. As it stands it doesn't have a lot of choice. You also can't watch movies you have downloaded offline? Surely that is the point of downloading them?",2023-04-25 11:10:07,1
"Terrible app, on phone and TV. Only got it for the ALeague and they've done an awful job. Crashes regularly. Have Paramount never seen another sports app before? Have a separate sports category and make it easy to find. Have the whole season fixture available for perusal and reminders. Allow for in game navigation (pause, rewind, etc.). Provide a range of highlights packages, not just whole replays and extended versions. Provide a run-down of the whole round for when we're time-poor. Pathetic.",2022-03-30 07:55:52,1
"Content is great. Favorite spot to get the shows I am interested in. The app sucks. Using on my mobile device it takes 5-10 attempts to launch. When using the downloaded content the sound and video often to sync up. Also with downloaded content it often starts skipping. When I watch something on the mobile app it doesn't update on my firestick at home. Causing me to now search where I was. Content is great, but the app is far behind its competitors in terms of quality and functionality.",2022-10-15 16:06:55,1
"Needs A LOT of work...... No picture in picture options, no split screen options. Fails to save the spot you left a video. Always starts over, sometimes on the completely wrong episode. Lacks a screen lock option. Very easy to slide your finger across the screen and mess something up. App is still young, but needs tons of help. Let's hope they fix it. Cancelled my subscription, and won't come back until they do ......",2022-12-14 07:45:30,1
"The amount on content in Australia is average at best. But assuming it will grow. Main issue is that the app is quite slow to respond, and missing basic features such as the plus button to add things to My List. It simply doesn't exist on the Android app, or native TV app. This is a pretty basic, but important feature of a streaming service. It says its meant to there on the website - but it is not.",2021-08-11 21:13:35,1
"It's a great service and I enjoy the shows and movies a lot. My 2 stars is because of how bad the app itself runs. On my phone, it wont autoplay at all, no matter what I do; other than that it's fine on mobile. On my smart tv, it errors out about 1/3 of the time I try to play a show. On my other tv which is an android tv, it doesn't give me an error; but if I dont clear my cache every few hours or daily, whichever comes first, it will stay in a black screen and refuse to load at all until I do",2023-05-25 01:09:56,2
Insanely broken app. It doesn't remember what you've watched.. Sometimes it cuts episodes at certain minute and starts loading another episode. You simply just can't watch certain minutes of certain episodes since it always throws you to next episode. At least when using Chromecast. EDIT: No help or response from tech support ever. But it doesn't matter because the app would still be broken. Had to unsubscribe because of this completely unusable app. Seems that the problem is very old.,2022-04-07 16:28:35,1
"It's unfortunate that the app has so many bugs and issues because I find its catalogue to be amazing. But issues with trying to continue an episode and it skipping to the very end and often starting the next episode instead and it's very difficult to try and rewind it in time. It's subtitles are horrendous, You are usually unable to see or read them as most of the time they are off to the very side and only show a small portion of the text and badly out of sync as well. And even more issues..",2021-09-11 14:20:08,2
"Not sure why this platform was made the options for the streaming service is very limited, certain features that are available on other platforms like being able to play/pause from the notification bar when you're not in the app is not even available. Realistically there are only two shows that I would watch on this platform otherwise it's not worth it. Performance is very good there haven't been any technical issues for the most part.",2021-11-09 13:54:31,2
"Really lacks a brightness control. Having to max my display brightness to see something drains my battery really fast. Also switching from phone to browser and back in the the middle of an series episode is a lot more complicated than it could be. That's mostly because progress is saved only ""sometimes"" at random. There are various other completely unnecessary odd design choices, especially with the browser version. Please stick to established standards for video players regarding hotkeys, etc.",2023-09-02 16:52:04,2
"No watchlist? It needs a watchlist. The user wants an interface that is on demand and ease of access to the content we want. Not having a watchlist slows the process down and makes the user not want to use the paramount streaming service. It's a flawed design not having a watchlist to add shows and movies too. It's a new service so the potential to rectify this issue can be achieved, if not users will go with other streaming sites that will cater to what they want.",2021-08-11 11:50:39,1
"Not bad overall, decent selection but the app experience needs some work. -Autostop after a few episodes. Casting to Chromecast, turned my tv off via smart plug but the show continued playing. Came home from work the next day and found out I ""watched"" 2 seasons. -A show you are watching will appear under ""keep watching"" but if you want to select a different episode, there is no shortcut. -Profiles would be a nice addition.",2021-10-28 04:35:07,3
The app needs work. It's barely functional and leaves unwanted screen icons on in full screen modes. I don't need too see home buttons constantly. The service it's self is okay but at peak times the stream quality is terrible. Paramount need to invest in there server's capacity asap. You can go from streaming uhd on Amazon or Netflix and switch to paramount and barely get a 360p stream quality at peak service times.,2022-09-10 05:31:03,1
"Useable app. Library could do with some additions but I get that will take time. Despite the A-Leagues season almost being over, there is still no pause, rewind, and start from beginning function for the live sport coverage, which is saddening. It also still takes far too long for the replays to be uploaded. An improvement in this department would go a long way.",2022-05-15 07:27:54,2
"Content is good, but the app is basic and buggy. Doesn't always remember where you last got to and sometimes starts episode from the start. Often doesn't give you the option to move on to the next episode. Downloads don't always work and it doesn't play well when you are on holiday, not allowing you to access your content even if you are only in another country (where Paramount+ is not available) for a few days. It feels like a beta app. Even subscribing and unsubscribing is unpredictable.",2023-08-06 20:58:33,3
"App is terrible, even though the platform has great content, the app itself is way too slow to do anything, the overall user interface is also not appealing, the lack of support in consoles also is terrible (can't find an app for ps5) the app in smart TV barely works and it takes 5 second or more to register every click, the best experience is in my phone which is not great either for all the above and for not allowing me to enjoy any big screen app, I'm stuck to my phone.",2022-12-08 17:42:08,1
"The app is good, I like the TV series but not many movies is there. One thing that's absolutely annoying is when you watch an episode of a show, the TV series won't show in ""continuing watching"" and I have to search and select the episode I'm on manually because the app won't track my progress. Also some movies I've watched months ago are shown in ""continuing watching"" although I finished them long time ago and lont let me remove them from this section.",2023-07-13 11:21:31,2
"Paramount is amazing for movies, maybe add more but that's not the problem. The two big problems are that the navigation bar doesn't disappear and it's very annoying! And also that the app crashes as soon as I scroll to the 'My List' section. Both are extremely annoying. Update 10/10/23: The app was updated and now the app crashes as soon as I load in past the user selection. Very big pain.",2023-10-10 05:48:48,3
"Good shows but breaks my device!!! I enjoy watching all the shows but the app is seriously unstable. If you lose data connection or switch from data to WiFi the app crashes but doesn't stop. If you exit a video with the home button it also causes the app to crash. The crashes cause my phone to run slow and laggu causing other apps to crash. Usually a restart fixes this but sometimes it doesn't, my phone reboots and immediately tries to resume Paramount. It's an older device, maybe unique to me",2022-07-24 01:45:47,3
"Horrible experience coming from Netflix & Stan, the user experience is horrendous. Streaming services are known for watching multiple episodes at a time, why is the know auto play or skip to next episode utility at all? Not to mention the extremely irritating skipping every ten seconds on an extremely fast connection, and then being told the video is unavailable half way through an episode. The content is great, the user experience as a whole is absolutely woeful.",2021-12-20 10:47:34,1
"Awful app and terrible functionality. I downloaded some shows to watch on the plane going on holiday and every 20 minutes, it starts to skip and jump which makes no sense since I downloaded them?!

"Update: latest version keeps crashing. Dec '22 Clunky and un-inntuitive, this buggy app seems to still had a way to go but feels like it was released early. A basic feature like jumping back into a series but not the specific episode isn't possible so you basically have to search for it each time.

"I love the setup of the app but it has a lot of bugs to address. You can only watch a half hour max before the film or episode starts to stop for a few seconds at a time. This even happens when episodes are downloaded. The only way to fix is to close and reopen the app. I hope the app techs at paramount will see this and address the issue. It's on it's way there but it pales in comparison to netflix, prime video, crave, youtube premium, and most other streaming apps if I'm being honest.",2021-07-14 12:59:36,2
"It would be good to be able to research programs in the app without having to subscribe. I am more likely to subscribe if I know what shows are available. Autoplay-next-episode won't turn off while casting; works alright when playing on the phone. Captions can't be turned off until the next episode while casting, so can't change mind during episode. Dark mode is good. I would like a cheaper subscription with a few adverts included. Sneak off for a leak or a mug of coffee.",2023-03-27 23:15:28,4
"Continue watching where I left of not working, no skip intro/recap function, subtitles not in sync. I have to say it's the worst app of all streaming subscriptions I'm currently using, prime, Disney and Netflix seem way out of league compared to paramount. Paramount feels like an unfinished product only for the make as much money directly as possibles sake but in the long run I think they are damaging their movie brands/ips with a lackluster app like that. Using it is/feels exhausting.",2023-08-20 18:25:12,1
"I received a three month free trial subscription, but I need to get paid to watch things on this app. TV shows often freeze or the app crashes. I've had to close and restart the app or clear cache in settings so many times. I give up trying to watch things here. I'm trying to put my feet up and relax but end up frustrated after fighting this app. The library of shows is cool. Device: Samsung S20 with updated software. Network: 500 mbD, 50 mbU",2022-11-07 23:44:05,1
"Good shows and really enjoy that some you can only previously get on Foxtel. But it is really annoying that you can't make profiles in Australia, despite there are instructions on the website for other countries. And you can't even save a watchlist. Need to improve those features and then it would be perfect.",2021-08-16 22:53:58,3
"An earlier review gave this 3 stars, now dropped to two. Content is good, but the app stopped working on my Roku TV altogether, and seems to be causing problems on my new Sony Android TV, disabling the audio, and causing other apps to stop working once Paramount is used. Only a reboot seems to help. Will revise if the problem is found to be elsewhere, but so far, this app appears to be the culprit.",2021-06-15 19:40:19,2
"It's hard to describe how bad this app is. Scrolling down lists of content it repeatedly jumps back to the top of the list. Trying to fast forward playback fails and then returns to the home screen. The content is badly indexed and organised making it far from east to find what you want. ""New"" films are decades old. Lots of old content and very little content. only streams in HD without Atmos/Dolby surround. So we have to pay for old HD content with poor sound for shows we had on other platforms",2022-09-16 22:08:21,1
"I hired this service in Mexico exclusively to watch the Premier League. It looks great. Seems to stream with out errors, but I have one comment: there should be an option to watch it with the UK commentators. That's why I'm only giving it 3 stars. Also, not a fan of the subtitles in Spanish. The translation is often very bad. I'd love standard cc in the language the show is in.",2023-02-20 02:09:13,3
Permanently stays on autoplay even when you turn it off. Keep watching feature has frozen on 1 episode and does not update in addition to new shows I start watching not showing up on the keep watching feature. Subtitles don't work. Whatever I watch keeps freezing throughout and sometimes skips the entire episode. Nothing to do with my WiFi speed either ad all other streaming platforms have no issues.,2022-07-02 12:50:47,1
"Downloaded it for a show on MTV I couldn't find anywhere else. I don't think I'll be subscribing past the 7day free trial though. The show stalls when trying to load and then automatically forwards to the next episode even when I've stopped autoplay and done everything on the help page (i.e forcestop, clear cache, make sure it's not internet etc). It's not an issue with my wifi either. Badly designed especially with how well other apps work. It's a pity to be honest.",2022-10-29 03:06:50,1
"Pathetic app. Buffers and stops constantly. At least once every 3-4 mins, if not more. No app for Samsung TV - this platform has been in development for a long, long time. They had time to develop an app for all smart TVs. Super unimpressed, only signed up for Dexter and at this point I think I'll find it elsewhere. It's painful to watch, especially after waiting so many years for the new season. Would not recommend this platform to anyone.",2022-01-28 07:04:34,1
"Content is okay, but app features are lacking. I start watching an episode, get halfway through, return to watch later and... starts at the beginning of the episode again, so I have to scrub through to where I was. Worse, this applies to episodes watched too! I can watch 2 or 3 episodes is a session, hit play the next time and I'm right back at the beginning of the season. No progress saved. Then I have to play ""have I seen this episode?"" multiple times to find where I was...",2023-07-28 08:16:49,2

I've cleared my cache, app memory storage, tried again. nothing. I'm deleted the app and reinstalled, and nothing. I've changed my password, to no avail. I've looked online and done litterally everything I can, and nothing gets this terrible app to work. Paramounts support is non existent. TERRIBLE",2023-04-24 03:21:50,1
"The app is slow, subtitles have a black background and cannot be changed, information requires two taps for everything and is so short, I still don't know what it's about. No cast and crew listed, search is tedious. The is either barely there or hard to find. All in all, by far not worth the money right now. Started the trial for a specific movie and as of now I won't continue the subscription. Needs at least a year or more for actual app development",2023-02-06 02:16:10,1
"App is still in its infancy as it is very average and has quite a few bugs and missing components. No watchlist, No 4K, No Dolby Digital or better, just standard stereo. App is also a little slow and rather clumsy to navigate. I'm sure they will iron out all these issues but until then I will have to cancel my free trial. Shame as I love annual subscription and Paramount does offer one for $89.",2021-08-11 12:11:14,3
No screen mirroring. So far only able to watch on my phone or laptop. Not on virgin media. Not on Older smart tv. Not on xbox one (region locked uk). Not going to upgrade all my devices that run every other popular streaming service with ease for the sake of a new one. Don't waste your time with a trial until it's actually properly established. You'll just be annoyed and frustrated.,2022-07-11 20:24:13,1
"App forgets where you left off and kicks you back several episodes or even seasons. Downloads take forever compared to other streaming apps. Most recent problem is its now using data even when the app is closed and all the settings to use data are disabled. Lots of great shows, but frustrating that you can't enjoy them on the app. Needs a complete overhaul.",2023-09-05 20:08:21,2
"I only really downloaded this to watch the new Star Trek. I think once I've done with that I'll be cancelling my sub and deleting the app until the next new series comes out. The content on the Paramount+ platform is a little lacking. I was hoping it's because the service is new but with no big announcements and most the shows being currently available on other platforms it's not value for money. The app it's self isn't great, missing skip recap and intro music feature. Plus it crashes easily.",2022-07-11 06:08:50,2
"Love the shows, hate the site technical issues. I contacted them a year ago, and nothing has changed. In play going forward or back causes the entire movie to shut down and can't seem to reboot for hours. Can't play on more than 1 device at a time, though, they say your allowed 2 streams per account, and don't give options for that. When they got back to me, they wanted all my devices, NOT going to happen. These are site issues, not device issues, might call netflix for some technical help",2023-09-03 18:40:03,2
"It seems to always have problems. Unfortunately it seems to be well known for poor service. Drop outs of sound and video, and freezes when stream all make the service a pain. It also asks during every game of football whether you're still watching. I don't know if it's an inside joke and someone at Paramount thinks the sport is boring but it doesn't ask if your still watching after hours of a TV series is streamed. I'd like to have the option to turn off the question.",2022-10-19 22:48:04,1
"I have no issues with the content but this app is severely lacking in features and riddled with bugs. For one there's no skip intro button, and there's no scale to screen so you watch content in a tiny box instead. I've found that the app won't even open if I don't have an internet connection so I can't view downloaded content totally offline. I've also found re-opening the app to downloads page gives an error like 'downloads are only for premium customers' then immediately crashes.",2022-08-23 15:17:32,2
"I'd give this app no stars if it wasn't for the content. It has a pretty good selection that I am enjoying. Negatives, it does not skip to the next episode, and the odd time it does it is only after the end credits. It does not have an option to skip the ""previously on"" or the intro portion of a show like every other app. It often forgets where you left off.",2023-10-10 08:07:41,2
"It is alright for a streaming service. I haven't had the problem other people have had. It has been working good. The only problem mainly in Canada from what I have seen is the content is very very small, about 40 different shows, and 50 different movies. Now it has great shows and movies that is only has but not enough for me to keep it past the free trial. If they start to add more content I might keep it. But nothing has been added to it from when I started.",2021-11-14 15:08:39,3
"I originally had 10 all access which was absolute trash and was getting ready to delete and then paramount+ replaced it. At the start it was amazing compared to what 10 all access was but now it seems to be just as bad. Constantly freezes, can't download all content, constantly have to uninstall app and re download, can't access downloaded content unless connected to internet which defeats the purpose. In this day and age it's an absolute rip off to charge for a service that isn't delivering.",2022-03-09 02:36:06,1
"The app is terrible. Doesn't track where you are in a show, so you gotta remember. The worst part is that a recent update causes an override of your screen timeout, so if you fall asleep watching a show on your phone (like I do), it will stay on all night. Absolutely atrocious app, but the content is decent. But the app is so bad that I'd still give less than 1 star if I could, regardless of how decent the content is.",2023-10-11 01:47:03,1
"Love CBS shows. The app, not so much. It is supposed to cast to Chromecast but it does not work the majority of the time. On autoplay it often skips episodes. When you first bring it up it shows a show I watched 4 episodes ago as the continue watching episode instead of the one I was actually watching. No communication from CBS as to whether or not they will be adding new shows or seasons.",2018-09-24 03:16:46,1
"When you start to play a video it is ok, but shortly after about 15 minutes it starts to jerk and stutter. I have tried downloading it, turning WiFi off but same issue. Tried on 3 different devices and all have the same issue. Only way kids and I found is to restart the devices every 15 minutes and continue the video. Very frustrating. Update: after having this for nearly 4 months, there is hardly anything on here to watch. If it was not for Star trek I would not bother.",2022-12-16 22:54:06,1
"It's not terrible but there's so much to improve. Episodes always start at the end of you already finished watching, you can't really advance like the other streamings ""play the next episode"" which is not awful not having because it's less abusive of our apathy, but like... Oof. Make better navigation. Also, just because I'm in Brazil doesn't mean I don't want the English Closed Captions. How hard is it to include it as an option?",2022-06-22 19:50:15,3
Update: It still doesn't work. Developers... saying an issue is fixed without fixing an issue does not fix the issue. ) Downgraded to 1 star! I signed up and binge watched a show that I love and it worked great. The other day it stopped casting to my Chromecast. it connects but will not cast anything. I have a Pixel 2 XL and a Pixel 3 XL. Both phones have zero issues casting with any other cast enabled app. I have zero confidence they will investigate or fix the issue at so I'll be cancelling.,2019-07-22 04:22:39,1

(tried several times over days to get it to work & its sporadic).

Other streaming apps are fine.",2022-10-05 14:22:42,1

Next thing I know, it's 2 episodes ahead of what I was watching. Really not satisfied. Don't waste our money until the rating goes up. I paid for a full year. My mistake. It also gave me an error notice in spanish. I had to go to google translate to figure out what was wrong. I'm not even near any spanish speaking countries. So frustrating. Ugh!",2023-05-11 07:25:34,2
The app runs well and has a decent choice of things to watch but in comparison to other streaming platforms is a bit expensive. Netflix and Prime offer so much more for a similar price and apart from a few exclusives most of the films and shows are available on other platforms. I would probably have this for a month to watch a few things and then cancel. In a way I don't want this to work as eventually we will have to subscribe to each individual studio at a massive cost.,2022-08-03 22:21:01,3
"The app needs ALOT of work. It behaves differently on different devices. On Roku: limited shows, only latest season, can't pick episode, doesn't add to watchlist. On Samsung tab: limited shows, doesn't add to watchlist. On web: only adds to watchlist after watching an episode. And of course, in Canada many of the titles are filtered. I expected Canada filtering, but because it behaves differently on different devices I will not be subscribing.",2020-04-17 12:07:32,1
"Huge potential with this service but this is a Minimum Viable Product at best and as such I cannot go past the free trial period. I don't take issue with MVPs, you can't have perfection from the get go, software dev doesn't work like that and that's what many people reviewing aren't understanding. However the service has been in the US for ages so it shouldn't be launching in the UK as an MVP in my view . Also there's a lot of buffering issues right now which makes things unwatchable.",2022-06-27 18:27:59,2
"Not a good start. Just signed up, and immediately the app tells me there's a problem creating the account, but I get a welcome email anyway. So I try the Get Started button, and the app (both on phone and Chromecast) tells that there's an error, and to try again later. 🙁 Now, second day that it's not working, no response from 'support', and can't even get to the menu to cancel my subscription.",2023-07-23 06:42:20,1

"Works, but feels more like a 30 year old website than a modern app. No apparent way to mark episodes as watched. The coding for the search box disables swipe typing (at least for Gboard users).

With Autoplay turned off, the Autoplay preview still takes over the screen, but with the caption ""UP NEXT IN [NULL]"".",2023-03-16 23:24:17,2

"This app can't do basic things that a video playback app like YouTube can do. When you tap to show the pause/play button, you can't tap again to hide it, and it takes ten seconds to disappear on its own. The app forces you into landscape mode for playback and displays your phone's buttons on the side of the screen, which is a bit distracting. The audio also keeps playing after you go back to the episode list. Good content on Paramount+, poor app.",2023-07-09 15:00:02,1

Fun fact about the seasonal ""Halloween"" picks is that it's actually just the only horror movies that are available on the entire platform.

Just some of the many issues are; *Doesn't remember ""last watched"" position across different devices. *When selecting from the Continue Watching list doesn't give you a menu option so if you need to jump 2 or 3 episodes you have to go back to Home and search for it. *Poor buffering so streaming often stutters, not WiFi connection as able to stream same program on Netflix perfectly. *Would go on but out of characters.",2022-08-20 17:55:39,1
Very unreliable and inconsistent. Freezes to the point of you just moving on from the app and watching something else. It's extremely weird as in there must be loads of bugs. Downloading episodes is even more unreliable than the actual streaming over wifi. I would try to just download my episodes so that I didnt have to worry about other technical issues and what not BUT the downloaded episodes rarely work. Its ridiculous and its been like this for months. Literally months and months.,2020-05-10 10:01:46,1
Had it for all of 2 hours before it stopped working. Played two episodes fine and then the third one started buffering every 30 seconds and then eventually wouldn't play at all.

But not to have some of the biggest Paramount movies on there at time of launch is unforgivable ('Titanic', 'Indiana Jones'... Just to name a few). Secondly, the app needs work.

You may want to take a look at the rest of similar streaming services like Netflix, Disney+ to add that touches that are missing in your one so that experience is more fluid and consistent across the app. In short, you need to add more content ( movies, tv shows etc.), make more user friendly and stable across different devices.

New user and have to say I really like it! The shows on here are really good. The picture quality is crystal clear and sound is really immersive. I'm using a mid tier phone so the picture ever-so-slightly jumps but I think it's the phone processor and not the app. I've glanced through the movies and shows and the content appears to cater for everyone.

Not shown anywhere in account or settings either on the app or website Actually unbelievable, I'm shocked So disgraceful Paramount plus sort this out asap Also please do not renew any licenses to show sport on your platform because we don't want you stealing our money",2024-02-05 06:10:02,1
The app on android keeps jumping as I scroll. Also when I stop watching halfway through a program and come back to it the app starts the program from the beginning.,2023-12-01 11:46:33,2
"Really useless. At least I got a response from the support team. I got it working again before they were of any help, but I expect problems to return. This app is badly made. Okay it seems to be working again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times. On the final one I cleared the cache first, then forced stop, uninstalled, restarted my TV. Then reinstalled and it seems to be working fine, for the moment. From what I've read online there are a lot of issues with your platform.",2022-02-26 10:48:24,1
"I recently subscribed to your streaming service to watch specific shows. However, today, while travelling to & from work, I was attempting to watch downloaded episodes (please note, episodes were downloaded on a strong wifi network), however, the app itself refused to open. I kept getting an error message. I understand diff apps have diff attributes & limitations. However, this is an extremely basic requirement. Why have the download feature, when the service can't be used? Please address!",2022-06-07 00:17:14,2
"Awful app. Watched a movie but missed the ending. Went back to try and rewatch, but just kept being pushed into another movie. No amount of clicking, holding or anything else allowed me to try and start the first movie from the beginning to then be able to rewatch the ending. Such a basic thing made either entirely impossible or too damn difficult, either way... Not good.",2023-09-24 14:28:46,1
"How in God's name do I cancel my subscription???? I've been trying for the last hour, and I'm going around and around in circles. Fed up with fuzzy pictures, sound that drops in and out and shows resetting themselves halfway through an episode. HELP!",2023-12-07 06:50:01,1
"This app is extremely buggy, and won't play any video, a complete scam.",2024-04-05 12:25:35,1
How can an app be this horrible. Do they not read the reviews? It is by far the worst of all of the streaming apps. Seriously...fix this. You can't resume a show...it randomly picks some previous episode. Fix it please.,2024-04-06 08:08:34,1

"Not sure what you people did to the fire tv app, but it is broken! One firestick and one 3 month old fire tv. I have rebooted my router twice, used wifi and ethernet, force stopped the app, deleted data, cleared cache, reinstalled, even factory reset. It doesn't work on either, yet it works on my phone just fine. 😡🤬",2024-03-05 16:59:56,1

"Not sure about functionality yet. Just signed up with the 3 months free from the McDonolds Monopoly game and based on what I'm seeing, I'll be cancelling very soon. There's hardly any content. A handful of shows and movies. I saw a video online from 3 months ago that included an overview of the Canada selection and soo many shows are missing. From what I see this is not even worth the $5.99/month... worst selection I've seen from a streaming service.",2021-10-30 22:06:31,1
"just shocking, the amount of content is amazing. it's the app itself that just shocking. I've got the app on my Samsung smart tv. when you resume a show, it always goes back the beginning. when you press pause it just keeps playing but the spinning loading icon. amd 50% of the time instead of playing the next episode of a show I just get a blank screen.",2023-10-27 14:57:50,2
I want to love this service the show selection is good the price is affordable but its kind of hard to enjoy the shows you like when the app decides that i have no internet at 8 pm almost every night. I'd understand if it was actually an internet issue but i have no issue streaming from other services of varying price range including the options that are free of charge it is just this one service that will not play videos after 8 pm.,2023-07-18 02:54:11,2
"One of the worst streaming apps I've ever used. Terrible movie / TV descriptions, no cast information, no skip intro / next episode options, when you touch the screen you have to wait 10 seconds for the options to disappear, when I'm scrolling through the movies the app refreshes the page constantly and if I'm touching the screen it scrolls to the top or bottom and I lose my spot every time and the app frequently forgets which episode I'm watching in a TV series.",2023-09-28 06:29:26,1
"Terrible! App consistently crashes while trying to open. Subtitles for some movies are only half showing. If you are watching a series, and have subtitles on, it doesn't automatically add them for the next episode. When trying to add them, surprise, surprise.. the app crashes! Paying for a subscription to yell at my phone basically 🤦🏼‍♀️",2023-07-13 09:39:47,1

"probably the worst streaming app. content wise it has some great things but the absolute disasterous app interface really takes any joy out of the experience. no play in window feature (and breaking when used with default android play in window), connection to server randomly cutting out every few minutes, no option to quickly switch between episodes of a show from the media player. just an overall nuisance to work with please improve your subpar software...",2022-01-04 06:46:28,1
I've had this app for 4 days now and has nothing I want so I keep trying to unsubscribe but none of the links to do so work. Seems very sketchy that they put you through all this trouble just to unsubscribe. Buyer beware!,2024-02-16 02:22:48,1
"Good content but missing features of other streaming platforms. There are several features of other streaming apps that make this a little frustrating at times. * Playback is not paused during telephone calls * No picture in picture support. * Completed episodes do not reset to the beginning making rewatching an episode a race to drag the progress bar back to the beginning of the episode before the next episode automatically plays. * No response to Bluetooth events, play/pause, disconnect, etc.",2022-09-06 12:39:03,3
"Honestly I'm happy I can watch Scorpion as this was what I wanted it for. But it has got to be the most painful experience. It always seems to be not loading (on my phone and on apple tv) never remembers where I last was, and always seems to not get the internet connection. When I'm done finally watching Scorpion I will take it away as it's not worth the payments a month for this.",2020-03-31 02:09:12,3
"Missing a lot of simple features like skipping intro, easily accessible episode list, the casting interface also has lots of issues like pausing and closing, but most importantly sometimes it is impossible to cast the show you want on the TV because of glitches. Also the content in Canada is missing most of the new Star Trek shows so if that's what interests you like me you're better off not subscribing for now, or subscribe on amazon prime for a better experience. This app is extremely bad.",2023-01-14 05:11:45,1
"I was so excited to finally download this app but was hugely disappointed. The videos kept cutting out then finally refusing to play then I get the message unable to play! Surely a company as massive as Paramount can get an App to work. I will give it a couple more days but if I can't play a video without it cutting out every 3 or 4 seconds, I'm out. To be fair I am sure I won't be going beyond the free week! Poor very poor!",2022-07-04 04:47:04,1
"Beyond a joke. Using in Chromecast/GoogleTV, every time I go to watch I get an 'Oops this video is not available outside your country' and I have to completely uninstall/reinstall the app and log in all over again to get any videos to play. And I mean that literally, every single time I use it. Just gritting my teeth and finishing the one show I subscribed for then I'll be uninstalling for the last time. If Paramount want to keep up with the 'big boys' of streaming they need to sort the app out.",2023-02-11 23:30:49,1
"Does what it needs to and some great content but really needs some basic features like maximise and lock screen. I use the app to watch videos while catching transport (bus, train, bus) to and from work and having 1/3 of the screen as borders is annoying on a small screen and not being able to lock the screen so I can still listen while walking without risking accidental touch is frustrating also. Even free video players have those features it's just not good enough for a paid subscription app!",2022-02-19 07:10:51,3
"Really underwhelming selection of titles, you'd think with a lot of people paying monthly they'd have some better things but unfortunately not. The horror genre really really needs more and simple things like an episode of south park having Spanish subtitles even when subtitles are off? Come on...you can do better...rookie mistakes for a premium price... (Updated 2-3 ⭐, it's getting better)",2023-02-17 03:31:18,3
"Good content but poor UI and buggy. You can't skip intros, you can only fast forward x3 which is laggy (on the sky box) and it often forgets where you are in a show. All fixable stuff and I'll change my review when it improves. The content is good for me but that's because I'm watching old stuff and love star trek. Not loads of new things though. It's start is no worse than disney plus so it'll get better. However, once I finish my old shows, there's not enough new stuff for £8.99 a month.",2022-08-31 19:43:09,3
"Really nice app, can be a little confusing how to find Genres at first and i wish there was a way to sort by movie release year but overall pretty great. Only watched one movie at the time of writing this, subtitles were out of sync but teething pains at launch are to be expected. Definitely worth trying out, even if only through the trial period. There's something for everyone and I look forest to seeing what gets added in the future",2022-06-25 01:56:21,4
"Do not bother joining Paramount+ till they improve the app. I joined on a trial to watch a show I was keen for, however the experience of the app usability has led me to cancel before the trial is complete. It's slow, buggy (crashing often), doesn't retain the shows you have been watching recently, when you re-enter a show you've been watching it loses the spot you were at so you have to find it again. Potentially there were more issues but I became so fed up with it crashing etc that I stopped",2022-05-29 01:00:43,1
"Casting from Android to a ChromeCast does not work (start for 1 sec and stop). And there is very little content. Like ... very very little content. If the app was working better it wouldn't be a bad app, the design is good. But a good design can't save the casting issue. No problem casting youtube, disney+ or netflix, so I feel confident saying it's a problem with this app.",2021-10-23 23:08:42,1
"Signed up through Amazon prime on my TV. Can't select that as a partner to sign into the app on my phone. Can't download a dedicated app on my TV, so forced to navigate through prime, so the searches all get muddled between what is included and what prime want to charge for. So I can't just look through what I can get on paramount. Some great content, just really lacking user experience",2022-09-05 17:49:10,1
"Very buggy and poor user experience. The app on my phone keeps telling me I need to download the app that I already launched to try and watch something. Then when I follow that prompt it loads and gets stuck on the Paramount Logo. The app for my android tv isn't much better. It's worked, and I started watching Halo, but it crashed during playback 3 times in the first 20 minutes of watching and it forgets where you were so you've got to scroll along to find out. Hope they fix their buggy app",2022-11-22 04:31:20,2

The screen will freeze but the show keeps playing, then I pause it press play and it fast forwards like a vhs player to where the voices match, then does it again.

"Some bugs need fixing, first the closed captions glitch out all the time and freeze or simply do not work which is horrible for someone who used them with everything I watch so I miss nothing, and often times if I stop mid episode I'd say 60 percent if time I can't start where I left off it resets to the beginning which is annoying, also please an option to put stuff id like to watch on a separate list",2020-12-13 00:30:02,3
"So frustrating!! The only reason I signed up for this channel was to watch 1883. And it only plays for 4 or 5 minutes then shuts down. I have tried all the help steps and nothing fixes it. If I had realized this app was previously CBS all access, I wouldn't have bothered as I had terrible experiences with it. Now all I want to do cancel my subscription to Paramount +!! And now that seems impossible to do. What a waste of time and money if I don't cancel before my trial is over.",2022-01-05 12:37:58,1

Too glitchy. Always jumps ahead 3 or 4 (or more) episodes at a time. I fell asleep streaming season 1 of Survivor. woke up 9 hours later to season 28. That's literally 400+ hours of TV in 9 hours. That's how much it skips. If I try to make it play the episode I want it tells me I have too many windows open. Even though I didn't open any additional windows. I have to shut down casting and restart the app every. single. episode. Turned autoplay off to try to gain control. But it still autoplays.,2019-04-05 09:19:05,1
"Garbage app with garbage service, would give zero stars if I could!! Make sure you cancel straight away, don't give them a cent of your money. The app is really buggy and is constantly buffering, and sometimes just freezes and switches off mid-stream. This doesn't happen with any of my other streaming services. Also there's no subtitles on half of the content and episodes of some new shows are uploaded 48 hours after they hit the internet - not good enough.",2022-02-02 22:53:56,1
"Surprised how basic this app is considering it's been out in the US for a while. No skipping options, lots of times it doesn't remember the progress correctly, no option to fill the video to screen. No 4K/HDR support for some reason. Series that have fully aired in the US (like Halo) are being released weekly to keep you subscribed - that's so dodgy. I won't be renewing.",2022-07-03 12:48:36,2
"This is probably the worst streaming app I have, only got paramount for atla cause it was pulled from Netflix. The app crashes, skips episodes, has sound and visual issues and will even close unexpectedly. And now I can't even find my watch list. This app is so hard to navigate and there's no incentive to stay if I'm honest. I hate to leave such a bad review but I am shocked with this app, if it didn't have all these issues it'd be fine.",2022-03-14 11:29:39,1
Shocking. I had a free trial but I decided to cancel. Very difficult to do so. I have still not been able to cancel. App says tap the subscription but internet says go to the play store where you bought it. The from. I will uninstall and hopefully will not be charged. The ONLY way to insurance was to remove the App from my home screen. Surely it shouldn't take that long.,2022-04-18 00:10:08,1
"Loading problems, I can go into the app and look at all the movies and shows and click into them to watch, but as soon as I get to the video itself it just keeps loading forever and doesn't even play the video.

"First of all let me make it clear, there's nothing wrong with the contents, this I a rating of the app. First of all the app works slowly, but that's just minor. It's more the fact, that subtitles float around on the screen in random, place's on the screen. It doesn't remember if your watching a series so every time you open the app you have to search it again. And wen it gets to the next episode, it has forgotten your selection. So when it comes to user-friendlynes there's along way.",2022-01-13 17:07:18,1
"Both, the mobile and Google tv app could use a lot of polishing. The tv app more so. When you select content to read about it and back out the app doesn't bring you back to the last thing you selected. Instead it brings you back to the very beginning of the main menu and sometimes can take way more navigation than needed to get back to where you were. I need to use cc when watching content and there are quite a few episodes of random shows that are missing any closed caption option.",2023-05-18 12:41:05,3
"HORRIBLE!! It will buffer forever, hen you click on a show, it will act like it's going to take you in and then kick you back to the main menu. You can be in the middle of a show and it will kick you out. I have a subscription but every time I log in it says subscribe to watch. It's not my internet as I can stream from any other program without an issue. I regularly use Netflix, Prime TV, Tubi, YouTube, etc... there are a lot of programs on here I would like to watch but can't! FIX YOUR APP!!!",2021-02-13 15:56:04,1
"Awful app both on phone and Samsung tv. Doesn't skip intros which is just basic stuff. The menus glitch and don't show images sometimes. The cast option is missing. Not to mention the selection of stuff to watch is pretty miserable even for a relatively new service. Update: it gets worse. On the Samsung tv app when it autoplays the next episode, sometimes it starts halfway through the episode. Not great for spoilers. This service is not ready.",2022-11-04 23:56:38,1
"The fee was 6.99/month when there was barely any content. more expensive than the US subscription, where they have more content than Canadians receive. Now they're finally adding content, most shows that are no longer on the air, and mostly movies before 2000. Now they want $10/month. Ridiculous!!!! They don't offer the ability to watch shows live. And sometimes it's months or not at all before they add new episodes that aired. Even for the Paramount+ shows!!",2023-01-22 01:26:31,1
"Forced to watch A League Soccer on Paramount Plus, having previously watched it for free on Telstra membership. Watching it on this app is AGONISING. There is no way to pause the live stream, or rewind, which I could do when I didn't have to pay to watch it. Live stream CONSTANTLY buffers, sometimes skipping over key moments of the game, which I cannot rewind! The stream crashes at least once or twice per game. Finding the game on the user face home is hard to do. Don't bother with this app.",2022-04-03 10:18:19,2

There is also some audio issues with some episodes, all you can hear is the background music and the voices are very quiet.",2021-10-21 03:56:04,2

But then it started to pause as if it was trying to connect to a network with the circle going around in the middle of the screen. I haven't been able to watch my 1 show cause every time I click on my show it takes me to a screen that has ""About"" at the top of the screen with the write up about the show!

Almost embarrassingly sparse. There's literally only about 40 movies available to watch. Honestly that's pretty average. Hopefully they will add more content over time but at that moment if you're not signing up for the football then it'd be hard to justify the cost.",2021-11-18 23:54:10,3

"Worst streaming app. The service has been fine for me. My issue is that the app can't do basic things like track the shows you're watching, the episode you're on or the place within an episode. Every time you launch, you have to search for your show, remember the episode and where you were within it. Baffled as to why this isn't done, surely it's streaming app 101 features.",2023-09-12 12:43:06,1

I cancelled the subscription then every 2 days I got an email telling me my payment had been declined, took about 3 weeks for it to actually cancel my subscription and stop emailing me. Also they cancelled icarly so no point having it anymore. Bad decisions all round with everything involved in this app.",2023-10-05 07:18:44,1

Cancelled my subscription the same day I joined. Very disappointing.",2019-06-25 13:31:55,1
"If you're from Canada, don't waste your time or money. I'd rate it zero stars if possible. There's barely any content but that doesn't matter because the app won't stream any videos anyway.

I reset the TV, uninstall/reinstall the app - no joy. About 1-2 weeks later it'll randomly work again. No issue with other apps & P+ app works fine on tablet/phone. Its just the TV app. 2. ""Continue watching"": doesn't carry across devices. So if I watch on 1 device, I can't switch to another device. I have to manually find my spot",2023-02-28 17:07:28,2
Got p+ to watch Trek. Selection of films is not great. The app itself still has a long way to go. Films don't have any cast listing. Limited synopsis. Pressing back from a title takes you to the top of the list again. Pressing back from the profile edit page exits the app. Profile pics are limited. Cancelled before my 7 day trial was up.,2023-11-05 16:28:49,3
"Ok I'll be completely honest, the content within the app is absolutely fine, pretty good, not as good as Netflix or prime but it's definitely worth the asking price, my issue is with the app itself, it's so uncomfortable to maneuver and feels clunky, it also doesn't allow Picture in picture mode witch is annoying because I can't do other things why the app is open 🤷 don't let that completely put you off though as I know the app is quite fresh and will probably be updated soon ❤️",2022-06-26 06:58:53,3
"Bad service The content is OK but my £1500 4k Qled smart TV can't play it. I had multiple engagements with what seemed like a very inexperienced customer service team who ultimately told me I didn't have an account, (I promise I do, I'm watching South Park on my tablet) and that I needed to turn it off and on again. Its a shame as at 5.99 a month it's way better than Netflix. But If Smart tvs cannot get the content to stream then I'm doomed to watch re runs of parks and rec. I guess",2022-08-02 06:29:45,1

I recently had trouble with the site via the app, so I decided to uninstall it and reinstall it to reset things, but now I cannot sign back into my account via the app. I can sign in from google but not the app. Same thing on my tablet.

Really sub par app. Really glitchy streaming service.",2020-10-27 21:41:55,1
Possibly the worst streaming service I have experienced. The app does not alleviate issues associated with the service. For some reason I can only see and play one episode of a series I've been watching. If don't disable autoplay and replay a series it will just keep skipping through episodes as remembers the episode as stopping in last 3 or so seconds . Can't see anyway to create a separate profile as described in the FAQ.,2022-01-12 12:46:02,1
"I am pleased Paramount has arrived in the UK. I'm not sure how mature the app is in the USA but it needs a lot of work. Finding playback issues where I will randomly get error messages or just drop out to the home screen. A 1H 30min film actually took me 2Hrs to watch due to the amount of issues. I have also had playback issues when starting a series or film only half the screen shows the correct footage and other half looks in decoded. Please make the app better, for Android and Sky TV",2022-07-12 14:45:40,2
"The platform is ok when you're online. But completely useless when you're offline. I downloaded the series and every few mins I had to turn them off and restart them again, some of the downloads did not work at all and when you're watching a series that has continuity then you're screwed... After I logged off and logged back in all of the downloads disappeared... that never happens with Amazon Prime, Netflix or YT Premium... Also a lot of options like subtitles don't work either....",2023-05-08 09:51:18,2
As others have said more functions required no ability to mark episodes and series as done that's surely a must. If you pause and then exit it starts again from the beginning I will update the review if/when these small issues are resolved quickly. There must be someone at Paramount who can sort this out. Your School report would show could do better in all areas.,2022-07-02 15:51:34,2
"I have had this app for roughly two weeks now and have mostly enjoyed it. To be honest, the only reason I have it is to watch Survivor. Streaming the program without the downloads is a little hit and miss. Sometimes I can watch a couple of episodes without a problem. On the other hand, it takes a few days to get through a single episode. The downloads are great. However, every episode I need to exit out of the app to sync the audio and display. Please fix those issues to ensure my long term sub",2020-03-31 06:23:35,4
"The app has some issues. It does not let me play my downloads, and it does not allow you to choose what internet you stream from (ie data vs wifi), so I have accidentally burned through all my cell data. I've never had a streaming app not allow you to specify this and the others all default to using wifi first, which P+ should really consider incorporating.",2022-11-27 13:56:55,3
"Probably the worst streaming app that exists. Not good enough for a paid service. Lacks the essential options to watch from live or from the start, or to skip back, which Optus Sport and Kayo have. Also takes forever for game highlights or mini matches to be available. And the standard response to all the poor reviews is pathetic. We have clearly told you what needs fixing, so why tell us to go to your website and provide more detail? Clearly they have not even read the reviews. Just do better.",2022-05-10 23:13:20,1
"Behind the curve. This is an entertainment app designed to show video but it fails to use more than 75% of my available phone screen. It also fails to buffer well, constantly stopping video with a non-descript error message that throws you back to the start screen. An average 30 minute train journey within London produces ten or more such errors. Really very disappointing compared to so many other video services",2022-08-02 06:37:53,2
"Absolute waste of time as it doesn't have a ""continue watching"" list so you can't continue watching once you stop. I contacted Paramount about the issue directly and they just replied saying they were working on it. Other reviews say the same thing so I assume they are not fixing the issue and I will be deleting my account after trialing it for a month. Not sure why the wouldn't want to fix this issue as they would be losing most of their subscribers this way. Oh well bad luck for them!",2022-07-10 11:37:25,1
"I am so very disappointed . You have so many of the shows I would love to watch at my leisure. I have used netflix and prime with success but I can not get your product to work . I can select the show and the episode and read the info BUT when I go to play it turns the screen , your logo loading comes on and I get excited then it just stays on the loading screen on and on and on",2018-10-31 06:36:24,2
"Poor feature set (e.g. no title skipping), poor android integration (doesn't hook into normal player controls so other sources pause when playing, or pause on remote controls (e.g. headphones). Weird screen framing and something not right about its fullscreen mode. Filtering and finding titles is very primitive and downloads are poorly integrated in an entirely separate UI.",2022-09-13 19:27:46,2
"The worst streaming app out there. For one of the newest apps it sure is in the stone age. It doesn't recognise which shows or episodes you've watched, and doesn't have a continue watching setting so each time you stop watching, you have to remember and fast forward to that bit when you return! Absolute garbage. Currently on a 7 day trial and would NEVER pay for this pile of rubbish. Won't be returning until they are AT LEAST at the same level as Netflix/Disney/Amazon Prime. Do not recommend",2023-09-02 21:36:26,1
"The interface is horrible compare to other companies like Netflix or Disney plus. While this isn't the first time this has happened but the biggest issue for me is watching shows and having to stop midway, hoping to go back to it another time, all content is lost and have to start all over again. So basically I have to remember what episode I left of and where I left off everytime. That's horrible...",2022-06-19 04:11:06,1
it pauses every few seconds!! really annoying when you are trying to watch something. I am not keeping it not worth it. I have extreme high speed internet so nothing to do with the internet and seeing from other people it's a issue with everyone. if you are going to charge for a service maybe you should make sure it works,2019-06-08 08:08:01,2
"Doesn't work the cast by any means... Many people having the same problem. When finally connected on tv through cast, only a black screen is shown. It's a shame that every single free app can be cast on TV and Paramount+ can't. It was supposed to be a top app, but really makes you watch it's contents on cellphone or computer... It's ridiculous!",2021-12-24 02:42:59,1
"Not bad but needs work, the people in charge of the app really need to follow the likes of netflix and amazon prime and have a 'next episode' pop up at the end of each episode, also, it would be nice if I could watch it as well as open other apps (like netflix) but not sure if that's a Samsung issue or the app itself. Otherwise, a normal new application that will require work should it want to keep up with Netflix and Amazon Prime apps.",2022-11-19 09:29:47,3
"It's now one month later & I still can't get onto this app:... I hav went through everything from troubleshooting to clearing cache & it still won't work!!!!!!!! 😡😡😡😡 so I now have paid for two months & got nothing to watch as it DOESN'T WORK... it goes to the blue paramount + but won't load any further... I've got HAYU, I've got NETFLIX & I've got AMAZON PRIME & they all work just fine..",2023-08-09 18:19:02,1
Decent but a very big issue is the fact that this app does not allow you to set up profiles. Every other streaming platform I use lets you set up profiles. I really don't want my watch history to be mixed up with other users and to have my recommendations affected by shows other people have watched. And considering apparently you can use profiles if you are from the US there is literally no excuse not to have the feature available in Australia.,2022-04-27 09:07:05,2
"The absolute worst. I cancelled my subscription days ago and paramount still took money from my bank today!!!!!! I had this problem in the past, it went on for months and took forever to contact someone about it because there is no easy way. I had to threaten to sue, I kept all screen shots of multiple cancelations. Which emails are recieved for too. I have to talk with someone again about this. They should be sued. Steal from people after we unsubscribe.",2023-11-19 07:43:00,1
Absolute worst app I've ever used! The amount of glitching and lagging is unreal. Can't ever watch anything I'm surprised it's still a thing. I wouldn't recommend,2024-01-18 09:27:19,1
"Pretty decent overall. Subscribed purely for Star Trek and Halo but pleasantly suprised by some of the other content. As some others have said, it could do with a few features being added to make it on par with other services; skip intro button, skip recap button and autoplay next episode feature. Not completely necessary but would round off a good experience thus far.",2022-07-19 21:07:13,4
"Bit slow to load sometimes and since it's a new service, it does lack some QoL improvements that I'm sure will come. Skip intro, skip credits and seeing the episode list without having to click off and navigate the whole app whilst watching would be nice improvements. Otherwise, great library and I look forward to more original programming/a way to watch premium US dramas without paying for Sky",2022-08-10 15:47:09,4
"I thought after trying HBO Max I would not find a worst platform. But I'm glad paramount+ has proved me wrong in every single aspect. This app is unusable, the subtitles are not even available for most shows, the screen is cut off, no profiles, slow loading times, the UI is the less user friendly I've encountered. Do not recommend.",2022-01-02 18:17:39,1
"It has Start Trek which is one of my favourite series, so I am bias. Saying so, Paramount has a nice selection of titles that are nice to watch. There is still a lot to improve in terms of the UI, but apps evolve slowly, so I would expect to take a year or two to catch up. I would suggest to the product manager that selects the movies to pick something less patriotic and cliché. The Asian series are interesting.",2023-10-14 17:11:06,5

"App broken and black screen after 1st download. I never even got the chance to use the app to review, it literally doesn't work. At all. My phone is a new powerful device, everything is updated. This is entirely the fault of Paramount. Their support cannot and will not be able to help because they are not app developers. It's like they don't want people to actually subscribe. I haven't even been able to use a free trial, let alone watch anything at all. Convince me to stay with 6months free.",2023-11-22 16:42:00,1
Looks like Android TV support has been discontinued in Canada. The US version is still compatible with Android TV though.  Also very little content available for $5.99. I cancelled my subscription when I found out that CBS sold all the rights for the new Star Trek series to Bell Media. They could have at least retained online streaming in Canada. Feels like a slap in the face so I guess they don't really want my money.,2019-08-05 14:55:22,1
"It won't let me download Yellowstone 1883 to watch on my Microsoft Surface Pro. I wanted to watch it on a flight. For Yellowstone 1923, I cannot download episodes 1 and 2, but can download episode 3. This makes no sense, as I don't want to watch episode 3 first? I find the functionality of Paramount+ to be poor relative to Netflix and Disney plus. I plan to cancel this subscription.",2023-04-06 11:37:08,1
"Recently started getting into Yellowstone and was travelling abroad, so downloaded a few episodes. They worked fine on the flight on the way out, but as soon as I connected to WiFi in the Philippines, all the downloads disappeared, along with the app not working correctly. Kind of pointless being able to download something if you can't access it... Will be unsubscribing as soon as I've finished this series at home. Unimpressed.",2023-02-16 04:04:04,1
"The app is ok, but barely. Running it on tablets, it is hard to find the show you are looking for, it usually starts the wrong episode and do not carry on from where you left it and I get odd behaviours such as jumping to a previous episode, covering the entire screen in a ""whiteish"" color and even screen flickering. I would expect more from a service that I pay a premium price for each month.",2022-05-09 19:11:17,2
"Apart from having to subscribe to another streaming service just for Star Trek, This app experience is one of the worsts. Continue disconnections, logins with partners do not work on the Android and is broken on the browser, a 2/3 mega down connection simply seems not to be enough, Fullscreen zoom keeps the Android interface overlayed, no skip intro, no next episode option, no resume on top when you enter, frequent disconnections and errors while watching, could continue but finished characters.",2023-04-10 17:39:18,1
"Well, it worked great the first time I used it on my smart TV. Problem is now all it does is load endlessly until I receive an error message. No internet issues, multiple attempts to reinstall the app, clear its data cache...REBOOTING MY ACTUAL TV SEVERAL TIMES. Still the same problem. Do better with your garbage app, Paramount - how difficult is it to make a streaming app with basic functionality in 2023? EDIT: LMAO their ""support"" site is equally useless. I'd give 0 stars if I could.",2023-06-05 22:18:37,1
"App can't que up the next episode on mobile devices. I've had the issue for a while, and I even changed mobile devices, changed settings, uninstalled and installed, logged out, and back in. Nothing seems to fix it. Content is great, and it's reasonably priced, but I can't get any help with my issue. It's just a generic response with a link to a troubleshooting page, which doesn't help.",2023-06-30 12:10:33,1
"Not badly set out for coming a little late into the game ( look at ur competition). Be worth 5 stars if I could continue to watch stuff on my other devices like Netflix, Prime, Disney. I can watch on my phone when I have a break in work, but have to continue watching on my phone when I get home because the have no app for LG smart TV or my Xbox one.

"Signed up, few days later got an email saying I'd changed my email address, opening the app I found that was true. No option in the app to change your email so contacted support and they changed it for me. You'd think, well they sorted it out, but, here's the rub. I'd contacted support using a different email address to the one I signed up with. So with no proof I was the account owner I managed to get the email address changed. Probably how it was done in the first place.",2022-08-07 06:42:01,1
Somethings to fix like the TV app does not offer a way to go to the next episode. There's no subtitle with transparent background. I have the app running on my tv and on my cell and I keep getting I'm using too many devices at once. The cell app player don't show us a way to go to the next episode or to choose between episodes. It also don't have a way to leave the video go back to the sinopses and we have to sort things by using the cells 3 buttons and leaving the app for this to happen.,2023-02-04 09:27:15,3
"The app isn't very well thought out. You click a title to read its description, click back and it takes you to the top of the list, so you then have to scroll back down and find your place. It's quite annoying 🙄 basic controls like Netflix and Prime seem to be lost on this app. No skipping recaps. Only signed up to watch one series then I'll be cancelling my subscription. All the same movies as other platforms. Looking forward to my automated reply about how Paramount appreciates my feedback",2023-01-10 07:47:57,3
"The app can not playback video properly! It consistently stops to buffer, my internet is fine and Netflix, Prime video, YouTube all do not have this issue! Even if paused the video dose not buffer past the pause point. And when playing video it constantly stops to buffer, I think it may be because it's streaming content not stored within the app. ""Not uploaded content"" maybe it's streamd from a cloud? And that causing an issue idk but I'm am really unhappy. Will change my rating when fixed.",2022-04-18 23:30:49,1

"Downloads available, great! However, even if you download the episode, if you don't turn off your phones data connection the app will stream using your data despite the fact you downloaded it. And if you do turn off your data it is hit or miss whether your downloaded episode plays or not. Learned this lesson the hard way when I used almost all my phones data for the month at work watching episodes I had downloaded over wifi. And there is no setting to make sure the app only streams over wifi.",2021-03-06 11:22:53,2
worst app for streaming. great content but it's difficult to re-watch anything. nothing loads properly and glitches often. Paramount do better!,2024-02-24 23:35:29,2
"Stuttery video on connection that supports HD netflix, no option for watchlist, limited selection, cannot find an android smart tv app so have to cast from tablet. Check back in a year because the app is easily the worst of all the streaming apps I've tried. iView and SBS On Demand, made for 1/100th of the development budget Paramount would have, are better than this. Why delay the switch from 10 All Access if this barebones bull is going to be the result?",2021-08-27 13:23:16,1
Partly good content but lots of bugs on TV app. Some episodes are listed twice. Some things are not listed. One episode is listed but does not start to play and is even skipped when watching from episode to episode. Movie does not start to play. Error: Content is not available outside your country. But I am in my country.,2022-12-12 18:45:03,2
"Terrible tech support. I called twice, emailed once, and tried chat too. On the phone for 15 minutes the first time, it sounded like I was finally going to speak to someone, then I got the dial tone. The 2nd time I called, on hold for 35 minutes. I could get the app to work on my phone, on my laptop, but not my firestick at all. Online troubleshooting was no help. I have never given a 1 star rating on anything before today!

Can't watch it on my Amazon fire tablet, unless, assumedly, I pay for it twice. Have tried to contact P+ customer services twice now, no response. Works well on my TV and Android phone though. Very good, very high quality content. 3* because of that lack of cross platform accessibility though. Still recommend.",2023-09-06 23:01:46,3
I love using this app however I wish this app offered in zoom support as I prefer to watch content by zooming into the screen as it fits the whole screen and don't have to see boarders around my screen which is quite annoying. Overall good app just needs a bit of improvement. Want this feature added in the next update or in the nearer future. Thanks,2023-04-28 11:29:53,4
"As a pretty good library, something for everyone. The app it self needs work. I try to download something and it tells me I've reached my download limit when I've never been able to downloaded anything because of that reason and uninstalled and downloaded again still the same and after watching something it keeps pausing so 2 stars would be 4 if those issues where sorted",2023-01-21 05:31:52,2
"Most of the basic functionality is fine, and works like you'd hope a streaming app would. There are strange limits on what can be downloaded to your device (certain episodes of series aren't available for instance e.g. I think the whole of Deep Space 9 S1). But the subtitles are the big problem and a disgrace. They're so laughably poor - if they don't appear out of sync with the visuals, the words just get smooshed up into garbled nonsense.",2023-01-22 15:04:07,2
Downloaded this app through McDonald's monopoly for three month free subscription. They used this as a means to lure me in as a costumer but have failed to honour this deal. The app regularly has glitches upon opening the app that can often be fixed by resetting it. I will say when the app works it works well. It is nice having access to some of the shows that have been unavailable through other streaming services.,2023-04-27 15:38:42,2
"The mobile app still needs work. The image won't fill the screen and Android's navigation buttons won't disappear, which is a distraction. It lacks classic Twilight Zone; there is only the terrible 90's remake. I'm not crazy about their movie selection. On the plus side, there is Star Trek Picard and Star Trek Discovery. It's all sort of passable, but it's not quite ""good"". It's certainly not a star above the Paramountain.",2022-11-14 11:35:28,3
"Really poor app. Constantly stutters and freezes while casting. Super frustrating when you're show is constantly freezing. The app is not laid out well, shows don't auto play next episode until the end of the credits. Closed captioning is awful. If you can avoid this app and find any other service for your show I'd pass on this app. Absolutely not worth paying for.",2020-11-15 02:34:45,1

"Disappointing. Only use this app so that the Kids can watch PawPatrol. Trouble is it ALWAYS defaults to UK English audio and my kids are used to the American voices.

No skip intro or recap so you are forced to sit through both and no skip to next episode at the end so you have to sit through all the credits each time. Very buggy and for some reason only works on my phone when I have it installed twice so I have two paramount icons in my app drawer instead of one. Also would like a synopsis to pop up when looking at show/movie icons. It's annoying having to go into a show/movie before you can see what it's about ( same issue with Disney plus).,2022-06-27 19:39:24,2
"Extremely buggy and not fit for purpose. I have to clear the cache for every two hours of watch time, or it starts glitching. Downloads don't work - the app doesn't load when I'm offline.

Yeah it has potential but a couple of ui tweaks could make it much better. An addition of a watchlist would make your experience navigating the app much smoother as well as a suggested content feature based on your previous viewing history. The app is also buggy when moving through content lists sometimes. Also.. it removed survivor all stars as I was half way through the season! What the hell! Just adds to the frustration,2021-10-02 15:19:30,2

Paramount+ on Android TV: I sent this feedback in an email & got a weird response that showed someone hadn't actually read the content. 1) The font in the show descriptions is so small I have to walk across the room to be able to read them. Also the show descriptions are poor & too short. 2) Also with the Chernobyl documentary I keep getting the 'not available outside your country' message.

"Edited review. Seems to be running weell no matter where you are at watching. This makes this app the best of the streaming services from the point of the modern transnational world. Good shows and movies, pity not some more content on there from other services, but that's not a complaint about Paramount really, that's the modern world also. So the good with the bad. Great job team though all in all.",2023-02-23 02:38:02,4
This app can no longer cast to to my Chromecast 2 and Chromecast Ultra devices whereas Netflix works perfectly on the same devices. Also my Telstra TV 2 device crashes when playing the first few minutes of The Rabbit Hole. Update: I have lodged the chromecast issue now with support. I managed to side-step the Telstra TV 2 crashing issue by uninstalling and reinstalling Paramount+ which is painful to do as the only way to re-enter the account login details is via the Roku remote.,2023-04-01 00:55:22,1

No easy search option, it loads a defult search page (5-15 seconds), then the typing has 1-2 second delay. It has no actor or crew info & either a brief 1 line, or no description. Has little exclusive content. It constantly jumps to the end of a title & then either plays the next episode, or just stops. Pretty, but flawed... Wait until patched.",2021-10-30 23:17:53,2

When I googled a few programs it said it was available on Paramount but once on the platform there were not. Finally, some episodes in a season are missing. Surprised how pretty bad this app is. Once I'm done watching Star Trek I'll cancel it tbh.",2023-07-30 10:43:39,1
"Straightforward and no nonsense, it does what it says on the tin. Provides you with hours upon hours of endless entertainment at an affordable cost. So far, had no worries in terms of lagging or loading times, app is fluid and runs excellently. Works seamlessly with both my PS and ROKU stick and it carries on wherever I left off, be it commuting to/from work, around phone calls etc",2023-03-11 12:47:11,5
"App never works, and I constantly need to reinstall the app. I get messages stating that it does not work and to try again later. When using it on my smart tv, I get a message that says the show or movie I am trying to watch is not available in my country, but I can watch it on my phone. I do, however, enjoy the content. It's the only reason why I have not unsuscribed.",2023-03-19 18:30:18,1
"STILL BAD! Came back to rewatch teen mom. For the WHOLE franchise, They show exactly ONE reunion show. But when you search online it says paramount plus has the reunion episodes but when you actually use the app it isn't there. Even on the website it gives you the 404 error page. This app could be so much better but it feels that the developers keep cutting corner which makes its infuriating. Especially comparing it to the other streaming apps. This one is completely at the bottom of my list.",2023-01-26 17:11:31,1
"THIS APP ABSOLUTELYSUCKS!!! And here is why - 1) No watchlist. You have to look things up every. single. time. 2) You MUST sign up for the 7 day trial if you even want to see what they offer, which is just ridiculous. 3) THERE ARE NO MOVIES ON THE APP!! ZERO!!!! Only shows, and not a great selection. 4) The user interface is terrible. Outdated, not very simple to navigate, and no option to find movies or anything as stated above. I will be cancelling my trial asap, after less than 2 hours.",2021-07-10 20:32:57,1
I honestly wouldn't bother buying the subscription at the moment as there is literally nothing on here. I think it will be good once they get their content back from the other streaming services but at the moment it's a waste of money.,2024-01-08 18:10:37,1
"This is possibly the worst streaming app, it never remembers where you left off, half the time you click to watch something and it does nothing, there's no restart option, half the kid shows say ""not available on kids profile"". (Paw patrol is apparently not kid friendly) Subtitles are never in sync, considering it's a similar price to every other competitor, it sure lacks every basic feature and actually not alot of content. Used it for a few weeks now and won't be renewing",2022-09-07 08:09:55,1
"The app fails to load properly, it either hangs indefinitely in the load screen or gives a black screen. I believe the experience is dependent on what phone and operating system you have; I didn't have this problem back when I was on the S10 and android 12, but now that I have upgraded to the S23 with Android 13 the app has become non-functional.",2023-04-23 06:07:53,1
"Terrible app. Some really great shows on offer but a very basic app that doesn't allow any advanced options beyond playing,casting to screens or subtitles. I have to go out to get to the next episode every time, very annoying. If these shows were offered on another service I would go there. Get with the times and improve your app please.",2023-02-24 07:05:24,1
"This is the only app that I could binge watch one of my favorite shows, it's great that I can watch most of it. I am disappointed that soooo many episodes where not available due to music copyright issues (?). I missed so much and had to figure out what was going on since this left me in the dark. I can deal with that but the series finale of a 10 season show was not there! For shame Paramount, for shame!",2023-09-03 14:39:13,3
"App, Meh Lacks basic streaming app functions. Such as skip intro and remembering which episode you were on. Content, meh Shockingly small film selection and mostly old films. Small TV selection, some good exclusive content. But I will cancel and just restart the subscription when a season has finished, then cancel again. Not enough content to justify longterm subscription.",2023-05-24 07:15:40,1
Not worth the price! $11.99 plus GST and my HST in Canada for Paramount. I don't think it's worth the price honestly. I watched 2 new movies not available on other streaming apps other then that... I think I will not continue to pay for nothing a month. It was affordable before and worth the price. South park is free on Roku all 26 seasons which sucks because I started my subscription to watch SouthPark 🫣 very sad for the price . I'm so disappointed bruh!,2023-04-12 05:58:12,1
"Just cancelled subscription which is unfortunate. App is very poorly designed, especially when casting. Shows have both episode number and release dates that do not correspond to each other. As a result when trying to watch a few episodes consecutively, episodes can jump from 1 to 4, back to 2 and later in seasons can even skip ahead to next season as release date on ep 1 of S2 could have a release date listed earlier than the final episode of Season 1. Unfortunately an issue across all shows.",2022-11-06 15:39:18,1
"Love the shows on here but the app functionality is frustrating. I recently traveled to NZ and I couldn't watch the shows I had downloaded offline. It also hasn't recorded what I've watched or where Im upto in a series for months and I spend the first 10minutes after I've sat down trying to figure out what episode I'm upto. The app used to show what had been viewed with a blue line under the thumbnail, but that doesnt exist anymore for some insane reason. Shows are good, app needs serious work!",2022-06-14 12:52:01,2
Customer services is slow and non responsive. After changing my password I can't sign into app on multiple devices. After contacting Customer service and providing them with screen shots I have yet heard back from them. I there is a problem tell your user if not atleast attempt to contact your subscriber after they have give you information you have requested. I may have to cancel subscription if no answer is given soon.,2023-06-26 00:12:30,1
"The Android app loads the content pretty slow, it lags a lot. I thought that at least the Samsung TV app version was a better or opyimized but it's even worse than the android. Sad because although I had a hard time surfing through the app checking the content I found some good content, but I don't think I'm willing to pay a subscription I won't be able to enjoy due to barely functional applications for mobile devices and smart TVs.",2022-10-06 12:24:54,1
"Pros: lots of new and exclusive shows, CBS live streaming, the UI is clean and easy to navigate. Cons: the app is quite slow compared to others on the market, only random shows/movies have the option to download for off-line viewing (most don't have this which is disappointing), lots of shows have incomplete seasons. Pretty average, but bear in mind it's still quite new. I'll update if things improve.",2021-09-30 23:00:27,3
"Will improve rating once issue has been resolved. Not sure what is up with the app. I can't seem to watch anything without access my account. Go to log in and access my account and there a error screen and under the same screen it shows invalid input and I can't access anything. I've tried to retry, I've tried to cancel out and it close it out. I've clear the storage, I've clear cache and still nothing. Needs to be fixed",2023-04-23 21:09:57,3
"I cancelled my subscription about 6 months ago, just joined up again and I see none of the bugs in this app have been fixed. There is never ending buffering when I try to rewind or fast forward. The app doesn't save where you left off if you stop watching in the middle of something. No profiles for different users. No app for a smart tv. Bottom line; this app is HORRENDOUS. Paramount Plus should be ashamed to change people $9 a month to use this app when services like Netflix have faultless apps",2022-06-21 03:53:21,1
"Compared to other streaming apps, this is a very distant last place. Too many glitches that could easily be fixed. And reading other comments it seems all they will do is direct you somewhere else. Listen to your customers feedback and resolve the issues raised. There are many good movies and series to watch but the app makes the experience very difficult and frustrating.",2023-08-10 07:48:45,1
constantly jittery every few seconds during playing of live sport. i have checked my internet service and getting over 100mbps so its not service. clearly this app has issues. what are we paying for?,2023-12-19 04:35:50,1
Terrible app / platform. No way to start a live match from the beginning. No way to pause or rewind a live match. Finished matches not available for several hours after completion. Have to scroll through all the random content to find the sport. Sport layout inadequate. Paramount should never have been given the A-League despite what they were willing to pay.,2022-03-30 08:07:32,1
Terrible experience on 4-5 year old decent mobile equipment. My Huawei mediapad 10 plays other streaming services that keep their apps updated regularly very well. Paramount has constant lagging in video and separation of video and audio. I have checked with other live streaming apps and not had this problem so it is not the internet connection problem or download speed problem as I have 400 over 200.,2023-07-22 19:22:57,2
"I read the promotion that Startrek and Picard and other movies were available. After signing up the selection of movies is third rate. The movies and series available are old and the description within each movie is so minimal, no names of actors. This is a poor excuse for an entertainment station. Paramount- should be Paramount minus not plus. There is nothing plus about it. It is minus all the things Netflix or Amazon prime and other streaming apps have. I have cancelled my subscription.",2021-11-22 13:12:25,1
"Good app, but only 3 stars due to not being able to download videos to a chromebooks external storage. Also, has display issues when viewing episodes (a lot of space between which means more scrolling). Otherwise, easy to use. Not sure if its because I keep my settings at SD, but testing an episode was smooth. For people complaining at the catalog (especially from CAN), check Crave, they gobble up titles first. Edit: checked this after a few months. Cannot even load. Get error message.",2022-04-23 02:34:23,2
DO NOT SUBSCRIBE. This app is pure garbage and that's probably being generous. It doesn't track your episode or show progress so it never remembers where you are up to. It will keep playing long after you've closed the app and will start with subtitles enabled every single time. Save your money and pirate their very limited library instead.,2022-06-01 07:44:59,1
"Bad. Started the 7 day free trial on my android device and decided to cancel the subscription before being billed. This cannot be accomplished via the app or the website. You need to open google play games, click on your name icon in the top right of the screen and navigate to your payments and subscriptions to cancel. Very frustrating and it feels like it was designed to be difficult.",2022-04-28 11:23:49,1
"App has a bug. Won't let me open it anymore. There are no shows of interest, save for South Park. App won't open, very few decent shows makes this useless and not worthy of monthly payments. But hey, if you love westerns, they push these stuffy westerns on you. It seems like the future on CBS/Paramount is reviving a tired genre, there are like 3 of them that could start at ANY time when the show you were watching ends. That was always a frustrating surprise.",2024-02-02 03:12:06,2
I am wanting to cancel my subscription and am not able to. Can't contact anyone to cancel it. Have done what the 'help' section has said but it seems they have removed the the cancel subscription section from the accounts for Android (unless its just me). They have minimal shows to watch and the one I did watch has ended so I have no need to have this app any more! So it is currently a waste of money.,2022-06-12 07:12:01,1
"The ui is the worst I've ever seen you'd think a company like paramount would be able to out a bit more money into this. On phone its never fully full screen and my buttons show up sometimes , no skip buttons no suggestions on other content when you read on a certain TV show or film . Plus is that it does have some cool shows and films but it's just not that great of an app to use",2023-06-28 22:20:43,3
"Issues are frequent and often. Crashing lag, always freezing. Avoid! I'm going to update this review everytime I experience the same issue of the app freezing, crashing, and then not opening. 😅 Again and again, finally decided to cancel. Bye Paramount! ""Would you mind rating our app?"" Clearly y'all don't care about the performance of your app, as most of the reviews are ""this is garbage, it doesn't work at least half the time.""",2021-10-16 13:14:23,1
"I like the idea of paramount plus, but I fear it's going to be the same thing as Netflix or crave, Canada and United States gets different content, which is the US almost always has better content. Google searches on shows will reveal that they are streaming on paramount plus but upon logging in and searching it does not. I am however very looking forward to the halo series, we never got a movie, but the series looks pretty good, as closer to a movie as we are gonna get, A+ to paramount",2022-03-06 02:59:33,3
"Good experience,except some casual interruption of more than one film.",2024-03-28 13:15:34,5
"Very poor viewing for the A League, constant lagging, casting it to the TV never works for more than a minute or two then it freezes for 5 minutes and you miss goals and there is no option to pause or rewind, and you can only watch the games from when they start there is no option to start playing from the start, it just starts playing from where the game is up to, it's very unfortunate that Kayo lost the rights to the A League but maybe Paramount may reach their standards one day soon hopefully",2021-11-20 12:05:04,2
"I came this close to subscribing for my love of star trek. But stopped short for the unusable app. The video even in full screen shows thick black bars all around, no brightness, volume controls in player, no skip ahead during intro/ casting, No next episode option at the end. Buffering the worst on same network my Netflix flies like the enterprise. Download not available on all content. Might I suggest fixing the app before fixing new deals to pull your content off competition. EDIT: Sent to support as suggested - Case #10890803",2022-03-10 23:47:44,2
"Billing amount increased without warning! I subscribed for $5.99/month and was billed this amount once, now the price is $9.99/month. Unsubscribe process very confusing. Very limited content. Takes forever to load. Streaming often stalls. Rewind stalls and freezes requiring user to exit screen and reload app. I'm done with Paramount+ after one month of use.",2022-11-06 03:57:15,1
Ok just been trying this for Halo but there's only 3 episodes so I don't think I will keep subscription until all episodes are fully available. Also keeps buffering every second and is unwatchable. Need more quality graphics options like YouTube for low quality for phones that having difficulty. Also unable to watch it on PS4 there is no app which is very disappointing I would have liked to watch on a bigger screen.,2022-06-25 16:11:11,2
I think this is the first time I have teared out parts of my hair because I couldn't cancel a subscription. I want MY money and MY hair back 🖕🖕,2024-03-09 18:12:47,1
"The app gives me error code 6290 when trying to watch videos. Tried troubleshooting with the link that is given when the error shows up but it leads to a completely unrelated search page on the website (searching the error code returns 0 results, they replied to this review with the same link). I then tried googling the error which led me to the correct page on their website. The page for troubleshooting basically says to restart/force close the app and try again and that doesn't work. App is 💩",2022-06-16 20:04:29,1
The CC subtitles are not available in my country. I pause any video and it wont resume and I'll have to get out of it and back into the content and the fact that you have to always get out of the current episode to go to the next and hit the main title for the movie instead of selecting the previous or next episode while streaming the current one is just a joke. Last the soundtrack on it's original language is no where to be .,2022-06-14 00:30:13,1
"decent selection of content but you guys really need to work on your video players. on both desktop and mobile I have major issues, like being unable to set the quality so every time I rewind 10s it reverts. also the full screen doesn't seem to work consistently, as parts of my phone's overlay like the status bar will sometimes show during videos. and on desktop I would have major issue with using the keyboard controls. you'd think a service designed for watching videos would have good players?",2023-06-07 08:31:49,3
"Not a great app, disappointing that I start movie, exit, then come back and the movie starts from the beginning. This app needs a Continue Watching option and it needs to show what I've watched already, as that doesn't show either. Update: To developer response: that link you provided doesn't help, the issues I have are options missing from your app?!",2022-07-05 19:08:54,3
"Frequent freezing, and if you try to fast forward or rewind it will freeze and need to be reopened, decent content but the layout is a bit of a mess, definitely worth a subscription but plenty of irritating bugs nothing that's ruined a viewing experience but definitely a little frustrating, it's impossible not to compare to other services, superior apps from Netflix and Disney+ this library is worth the subscription but neither library nor the app live up to the competition",2021-12-17 13:14:55,2
"Great content, Average at best experience with glitches - App randomly crashes often. Downloaded content has audio issues on Android and Apple devices. Force closing app fixes temporarily but comes back. Not able to link to Amazon account, costs more to be able to play through Prime. Only place to get some of the content I want so no choice.",2022-12-18 22:04:49,3
"Quite possibly one of the worst streaming apps. Can't open the app without service or wifi so downloads are useless. Sometimes the downloads won't actually play and you have to stream it. The app glitches and boots you out randomly. All around horrible, if it didn't have exclusive shows I wouldn't even bother but once I've gone through them it will be discontinued.",2022-03-06 06:39:14,1
Can't watch anything in other languages. Even the app has mix languages text when the phone is set on a language other than English. Also 5 times out of 10 when I start the app I get a black screen. When I watch a show or movie the android navigation bar stays and obstruct part of the video. While watching when I go backward to review something I end up with the loading circle and have to reload the app.I was able to watch the stuff I wanted. This app is somewhat fonctionnal.,2022-11-14 22:33:11,3
"Godd app, good content for a reasonable price. Only thing that's annoying is that you can't pause video with your headphones. Every other video app or streaming will pause playing the video when I would take my headphones off or press pause on them (Sony xm5). Can you add that feature? Edit: thanks for responding and taking care of this.",2023-03-13 19:10:56,5

I'd give 5 stars but there is some things paramount needs to fix. The message saying there is to many people watching when it was just me and my husband using the app and the fact that you can only download select TV shows and movies and not even the whole TV show it only let's you download a couple episodes not even the first two episodes what's the point of having the download feature plus there is basically nothing to download for kids. When you fix your app I'll change my review,2023-04-04 17:36:56,2
"Really like the app has improved loads since first realeas, only annoying thing is the phone bar at bottom doesn't disappear while watching a Movie/TV show",2024-02-25 22:00:44,3
"Worst streaming app on the market, full of bugs. It doesn't even open most of the time! It autoplays the next episode even when you deselect that option. There's often minor buffering, which I rarely get with other apps. Content is poor compared with the other aps, although there are a few gems like Dexter and Broad City. Edit - they removed a show I was watching without warning. Then they put it back after a few days.",2022-12-13 07:35:12,1

"Ultimately it works, usually fast, but the app has some major upgrades needed. The PIN lock system needs to require a PIN to access an adult account, and not to try and leave a children's one. When pressing back, it should either go back a page or the home screen of the profile you're on, and not close the app down. There needs to be a way to view the entire library, and not just selections for each category. The films section doesn't populate properly and needs work.",2023-03-12 15:30:03,3

If Netflix can make an app that allows me to watch videos in 1080p without any lag, CBS you should be able to do it too. Video content is far below expectations.

Reset my router, forgot my wifi on each device and reset, deleted and installed app. Not always watching during prime time and still happens.

It says ""we are experiencing technical difficulties"". 2) you turn airplane mode on and it let's you browse your downloaded stuff but when you try to play it ""an error has occurred"" 3) your video you half watched is magically gone. 4) it actually works. It's just not worth the trouble. I cancelled my all access cause of offline/downloaded errors.",2020-08-28 01:48:01,2
"Not impressed by the app so far. On Chromecast and on Fire Tv. There does seem to be a ""resume playing"", unless I'm very mistaken. If you stop an episode anywhere and leave it (turn of the TV, go back to menu, etc ) you'll have to seek manually to find where you were. How is that acceptable from a mainstream app in this day and age ? Please tell me I'm wrong",2023-07-17 19:38:45,2

Followed there instruction multiple times,still doesnt load. Is there an actual person in support ,seems like a computer generated reponse .Running Android 13 on a S23 ultra with 5g.

Secondly the user interface isn't very good it doesn't autoplay and navigation of content is counterintuitive... Hopefully this improves over time and more content is added quickly but for now I wouldn't recommend especially if you already have Netflix",2022-06-24 16:54:48,2
"The app could load things a bit faster in my opinion, sometimes it gets stuck in a loading loop and I have to restart the video. Also please make all movies and series available for downloading. Could you also please add a skip intro button for shows and a skip to next episode at the end of each episode so you don't have to sit through the credits. Also, please add Picture in Picture mode",2022-07-28 13:26:12,4

I understand the service accounts for three simultaneous viewings.",2023-10-03 08:46:06,1

If anything I would have expected it to default to French, again because I live in Canada. There has to be a much more intuitive interface. I should not need to spend 30 minutes re-launching the app just so I can access it properly!! Until this is fixed I am giving this 1 star. Only because I cannot give it 0 stars.",2022-04-14 16:00:11,1
Compare it to other streaming apps and you can see a huge difference. Far less shows than you'd get with Netflix/Prime etc You can download shows and movies but if you don't have data the app just won't open. So I download the shows with WiFi to watch when I don't have data but it just won't work? So many little bugs that are just annoying to use. If it wasn't for Yellowstone I'd have deleted it already,2023-01-12 13:57:50,3
"Great programming, HORRIBLE app! Constantly crashing. Takes 15 to 20 attempts just to play a show that I HAVE ALREADY DOWNLOADED! When streaming, it won't pause to buffer, so it just constantly jitters so the audio becomes unintelligible. I only keep it because it's the only place I can get this programming. I thought a company the size of Paramount could afford better than a 1st year programming student. :(",2021-05-22 01:52:33,1
This app is terrible. Anything I watch just starts freezing and becoming jerky after about 15 minutes. It then starts to bug out and you can't even control the app. I have to force quit the app and then relaunch it to resume watching stuff (every 15 minutes). I see other reviewers have the same issue - guess paramount aren't listening. Annoyed at developer responses on this issue. There's enough reviews for anyone to know there's a problem. Just deal with it.,2022-10-17 21:40:05,1
"Bit user friendly, skips back episodes - normally have to search for the show again to get into the episode list to find your correct place.

I have Netflix, Disney and Prime and ALL 3 allow you to sign in anywhere.

Mobile app only works occasionally, even if I download a show to watch off-line the app will search for signal, or tell me I have no downloads, or buffer like its lost signal or show me that I have downloads and then not allow them to load.

Unable to cancel my subscription on all devices I use it on. The cancellation system is ridiculously complicated and makes no sense.

Absolute rubbish!! For such a large company who is not short of a dollar this app is the worst paid streaming service I have ever used. This exact app is available in other countries!! And I assume it works fine there. How hard is it to make it work?? It crashes on multiple devices It lags (even with downloaded content) The whole service went down for a day. It will work for a short period of time then both my phone and tablet freeze to the point the device needs to force reset to recover.,2021-09-06 07:13:42,1

Only bought because of A-league rights, will not renew.",2022-05-01 12:28:31,1
Pretty good app but needs some features fixing/adding. 1) Video doesn't save your place if you need to stop watching 2) even with autoplay on it takes you off the video after each episode 3) pressing the screen brings up the pause and skip buttons but there's no way to take them away once you're done.

"Needs a lot of work. There is no way to remove a movie/series, that's a complete yawn fest, from the continue watching list; at the end of a movie it will just start playing some random show that has nothing to do with anything, and then you're stuck with that in your continue watching list as well; there's no way to rate the shows you watch/started watching and hatred so the recommended viewing has more to do with the colour of the weather girls drunken vomit than your actual genre preferences.",2023-06-25 07:43:38,1
Great app now that you've improved the streaming service. Still like the app but I think the ability to download episodes could be better and faster (like Netflix).

Don't bother with this app.",2022-08-23 09:56:20,1
I'd give it a zero. Doesn't save last viewing episode. Customer service acknowledge many technical issues in an email. My profile was hacked by other unknown users and customer service blamed me. And now when I go to it screen says 'opps error having technical issues' and again customer service blamed myself and my smart tv. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as it doesn't happen on other steam apps. I had high hopes but it's a fail streaming service that takes money but doesn't offer.,2023-02-06 16:14:50,1
This app does Paramount no favours. It's too hard to find content that is being live streamed. No ability to rewind. Useless Live TV section that takes up menu space. Update: I sent feedback email to support before this review. Got unhelpful/irrelevant response first in Danish and then in English. Incompetence all around.

Good value but low on content. I only use this app on and off due to its lack of content that suits me. In saying this I've also stopped Netflix for the same reason. I enjoy ad-free streaming apps for the kids (as advertising creates psychological issues later in life) and this one delivers for the kids and adults. The content itself is different from the others not just because it's Paramount but also its tone is less serious and more fun oriented and I guess lighter in mood. Good value.,2023-10-30 23:53:00,3

Terrible app. I purchased it after false advertising on their content they streamed. Now I tried to cancel my subscription and it's an absolute run around doing everything they can to make you get sick of trying. The movies and shows are a very poor selection for the price.

"While it's great that it's finally made it to Ireland, the content is extremely limited, especially on the Nickelodeon side of things.

Paramount don't exaggerate with political correctness, which is missing, for example, from netflix. the only thing missing is a well-working offline player, despite the downloaded series, it is impossible to watch it, maybe it's a bug in my phone.",2023-02-26 13:31:54,5
"There are some huge technical issues that need to be addressed. After watching about 2 episodes, the whole thing starts to lag and glitch out. The only way to fix it is to restart the app. The same thing happens if you pause for too long. Considering its paid content, we should at least be able to watch it without issues. There are more issues but I've run out of characters and they aren't as pressing.",2021-03-17 00:50:50,1
Worst streaming app ever - started watching a new series and got really confused with the plot jumping all over the place. Turns out Paramount Plus chose to shuffle the episodes and play them out of order! Why would I want that? Now I'm trying to cancel but the link to cancel has disappeared which means now I have to go through extra hoops by contacting customer service - what a pain!!,2022-12-18 00:58:35,1
"No ""continue watching"" function - leave an episode half way through and you have to find the point you left off yourself. Subtitles seem to switch off? I've had to turn them back on a few times, and for Gilded Age ep1 in particular they seem intrusively positioned and almost a whole sentence ahead of the show dialogue, so very unhelpful for HOH using them to catch missed spoken words.",2022-04-23 03:26:23,2
"Unable to unsubscribe. According to their online account, 'to modify your subscription, please do so in the app store where you purchased your subscription', when you enter the app, the only options are monthly or yearly. No cancel option. Not only is this incredibly annoying given their free 7 day trial will likely end before they respond, the app itself is very average. Coverage of the a league is far below Optus standard. Massively disappointed.",2021-11-22 03:46:05,1
"First, it refused passwords, even after each reset. Tried to cancel, each method is either a dead end, or faulty instructions. Was attempting to get a video on prime and was offered QR code as an alternative, which took me to Paramount. Reluctantly joined, but movie not there. But I do have their icon constantly on the screen. 3 different sets of instructions: via prime, via Android mobile, and via Chrome. Still trying to cancel",2023-10-22 05:50:28,1

"App is slow and buggy. If used on a chromebook laptop the screen is just grossly over brightened so much that you can't see the show you're trying to watch and there's no settings option to change this, its not my laptop because netflix doesnt have this issue, it also flashes and glitches and randomly stops working. Please fix these issues.",2023-04-15 21:07:45,1
"Consistently crashes. I frequently have to restart my phone to get it to open. You guys definitely have the money to make an app that works. If you wanna keep customers, you best get on that. Definitely not keeping longer than my free trial if this isn't fixed. Also skips episodes when you're trynna binge a show which is very frustrating",2022-05-25 23:25:36,1

The phone app is ok albeit under featured but the TV app on my modern up to date Samsung TV just doesn't work. Tried reinstalling it but it's hit and miss as to whether you'll be able to access content or play it. Content which is promoted like Frasier plays but anything you search for often just won't play and the app then freezes up. I won't be maintaining my subscription on the basis of only being able to use the phone app.,2023-10-28 08:04:55,2
"It's getting better, but still decade behind others, bugs- not remembering when u finished watching last, tap on screen- to show Controls, u can't just tap again to get em to disappear.. u need to wait before these goes off, no brightness slider, sometimes closing the app while watching won't remember where u paused it, take a lesson here from Netflix, their app is absolutely spot on",2023-05-18 16:45:54,2

All of my other streaming apps are working perfectly and my internet is with starlink with speeds at 56 at the lowest.

My review will remain until the problem is finally resolved.",2023-08-16 14:45:59,1
It is getting better. Getting more things to watch and becoming more stable. Still has some weird bugs. For instance doesn't let me cast house of lies to my Chromecast. It works normally with other shows and also it let's me stream it on my phone... Just not in the Chromecast... That specific show... Don't understand how could this happen but it does. Still... Getting better to be honest.,2021-06-09 02:51:41,4
Constantly freezing and lagging. Always stopping a program with error codes. Nothing to do with my Internet as other streaming sites work fine,2023-12-20 19:49:13,2
It's not a bad app in all. I know it has only just launched here in the UK but sometimes I'm having to open the app 2 or 3 times before it loads up and the option to zoom the video to full screen is lacking. It is very annoying seeing big black borders on a phone screen.,2022-06-22 15:13:05,3
"The WORST streaming service I have ever used. I've had it for a week now and although you may think it's a bit harsh to come to this conclusion so quickly I have only managed to actually watch something on here TWICE! the roster of shows is okay but far from impressive and the app is useless. Fast forward to today when I've decided enough is enough I'm going to cancel the subscription before I'm charged for this nonsense and I can't access it! Chrome, fire tv, android app nothing! Just avoid it!",2023-03-01 20:43:24,1

"Surprised to leave 1 star on any app. This appl isn't usable. It will not load anything despite a strong internet connection. More than half the time I have tried to open it, it won't even load past the paramount logo.

Need to cancel my subscription because I have no way of watching aside from my laptop.",2022-08-30 12:28:24,1
Constantly buffering it can buffer up to 15 or more times in 5 minutes had taken around 18 minutes to watch 10 minutes of an episode also has a error come up occasionally saying it can't play right now. I have never had such bad streaming on my phone for episodes or movies on any other app it's a shame as there is some great choices on the app to watch,2022-05-11 03:38:46,1
Lose the opening animation when starting the app. It freezes or fails to load and eventually takes about a minute of a black screen before I'm able to use the app. This is just another failed attempt at turning into a streaming service. This service should be free and without ads until they're able to roll out a proper and functional product. This is pathetic and y'all should be ashamed of yourselves.,2022-04-25 14:08:59,3
If you stream to Chromecast it works but when you use the subtitles it only goes to left of the screen and you can't even see them all. AirPlay is almost unusable. My airplay on my iPad works for everything except for this app. There login system is ugly. If you happen to log out. The password that you would use in my case 15 minutes before. I logged out tried to log back in. Wouldn't work. Went back to try and get a new password. Said anything I did was invalid. Don't waste your money.,2020-12-19 06:09:32,2
"I originally got Paramount+ for South Park but the selection has blown me away, the reason I am leaving a 1 star review is because the app is so buggy and if it isn't fixed by the end of November I will be cancelling my subscription. The issues I've had so far is that some episodes I watch do not have audio, then on my Samsung smart TV the app is constantly crashing and episodes are just randomly freezing with no buffering icon and then it just randomly blank screens.",2023-11-10 00:18:19,1

"After reading reviews I'd decided not to purchase. Since then ive seen the app updated and tried it . No complaints now . A reasonable amount of content. It casts to my TV perfectly and you can resume a programme from where you left off from my list . You can now skip recaps, at least on the show I was watching .I now pay for it , although it has the advantage of no lock in period if paid for monthly",2023-03-14 13:45:46,4
"Got a subscription as an add-on to my Prime membership, but I found a US help centre article that mentions you can 'verify' your Amazon details so that you also have access to this app and the website. Turns out this is not a thing, at least in the UK since the only provider available is Apple TV. Why? Content-wise, everything on the Prime app works as expected, but another thing that bugs me is that I do not know if there is any content (amount) difference between Prime and this main app.",2023-02-09 19:19:37,3
Keeps reloading tiles when I try and browse what's available. Adding an item to your list reloads the tiles again so you have to scroll back down to where you were. Watchied an episode of Halo on my LG TV and the dialogue was very low compared to the rest of the sound (connected via eArc to my denon amp). Netflix / Prime Video / Disney + all work OK. Watched a star trek short episode. It started playing but the white spinner wouldn't stop. Playback errored shortly after. Needs improvement.,2023-09-17 17:29:16,2
"New releases (movies/series) are few and far in between. They need more new product to be released regularly e.g; Netflix and it would be up there but I've already watched like alot of shows and that was a while back and everytime I log on and look, there's been no new releases. Makes me wonder if I'm wasting my $$$ on Paramount when I've got Netflix, Stan, Disney, so plz bring out new stuff to keep me subscribed to Paramount.....",2022-09-16 07:18:59,3

Rubbish app can't login properly and confused google password. Simple subtitles have to be reinstated as cc text every episode and they don't completely match the speed of talking and they get chopped off half the edge of the screen. Also app doesn't allow skipping of intros or recaps and doesn't automatically go to next episode at end of current episode. It runs out the entire credits.And simple response to review is a link for assistance. I don't need assistance. You need to make a better app.,2023-04-23 08:31:09,1

"If you're hoping to watch your favorite shows via mobile data on your phone or tablet, think again. Constant buffering even with 4G full bars and even on 5G sometimes. Which can be especially frustrating when all other streaming apps work with zero buffering, which leads me to believe Paramount have got some serious background data going on",2022-08-04 18:50:58,2
"The app is working great so far. I'm glad I can watch Star Trek Discovery. But it ain't much series or movies to choose from, sadly enough. Perhaps there'll be more soon. I was surprised that the app didn't have fit to screen as Netflix and HBO max have. Edit: After been using the app to watch Star Trek Discovery. It worked great for two episodes and after that it started to lagging often. I thought it was my broadband that was messed up, but nothing wrong there.",2022-03-05 01:45:26,3
"Update** now had to cancel my subscription due to my account being hacked & no help or replies from you Continually getting an error message. Re: experiencing some technical difficulties check back later. Paying for a subscription on an app that has limited viewing like this is unacceptable.

"The contents themselves are good, but the android app is slow, thinks it's offline while being online, it's overall buggy, unpredictable and lacks basic features like skipping to next episode (you have to go through all the credits of each episode for it to happen automatically), skipping intro/recap, or even going to episode list if you started watching through the ""continue watching"" button from the main menu",2023-02-15 13:15:48,2

So tried to play it on my phone and cast to the Xbox or ps4. Nope, casting icon is faded in top right corner and doesn't let me activate it. Not new to this tech, not new to how it works. After going through multiple threads on the internet. It is very clearly this paramount+ streaming service. This issue is not new either. Fix it.",2022-01-21 02:00:33,1
Garbage app. Unlike every other streaming service where you can use it any country but the available streaming catalogue just changes for that country. With this app you just get locked out for licensing issues and you can't watch anything. Also anything you've downloaded you cannot watch in another country. Also it's been a year and there's still no app for the Xbox store in Canada.,2023-09-05 13:55:49,1
"The worst UI of all the streaming services, by far. Navigating and searching for content is painful, the absolute worst. Loading downloaded movies when I have no signal (on train to work) take a ridiculous amount of time. Having to deal with that stupid animated logo every single time I open the app. Has removed downloaded movie before I finished Constantly loses my progress on movies when I come back to them In general poor UX and performance",2022-08-01 20:38:09,1
"Unwatchable. Downloaded this onto my phone as the app no longer works on my television. However, the video buffers after less than five seconds after clicking play and nothing I do actually works to get the buffering to stop. I am very disappointed in this app and am going to be removing it and going back to Netflix and Disney+ which is a shame because some of my favourite television series are only found on Paramount+.",2021-08-26 00:39:03,1
"Awful, so laggy and disruptive. I was looking forward to watching the Transformers movies, upon downloading this app I've been greeted with nothing more than buffering (My WiFi is just fine) and lagginess.

"This is the worst app ever. If you download shows, they still stream off wifi or data unless you shut it off. There is no option to stream on wifi only. Streaming is choppy and stalls constantly, it is unwatchable. If you download content, shut off wifi and data so that it will play from the download, it works for 1/2 - 1 show before stalling and becoming choppy at which point you have to completely shut down the app and restart it for it to play half decently. How can a download play choppy?",2021-04-11 20:54:55,1
Lower quality app not like Netflix or Prime. On phone or tv: you can't remove from continue watching. On phone or tv: I'm watching a movie and I restart it and it doesn't appear on continue watching but a show I finished still does🤦🏻‍♂️. The movie restarts from the begining. On tv: it doesn't even want to play the movie😡😡. I know I'm not the only one complaining and I don't see any response from Paramount. When the issues are resolved I'll give it a 5 stars.,2023-02-14 01:40:17,2
"I am dissatisfied with the CBS All Access application. I have uninstalled the application numerous times on my smartphone. And after re-installing it it doesn't seem to make a difference. It keeps loading, and the screen shows black on the phone when you try opening the application. This is frustrating since it is an application that you need to subscribe to in order to use it.

"Good movies extremely bad app. Took me 2hrs to watch a 50min show as it buffered continually would show about 1 min of content then buffer again or just dropped out completely so I had to come out of the app completely select my show again and try again. I did this probably a 100+ times to just watch one episode of one show. No way to put in a proper email complaint with paramount just this way and you get a useless automated message saying ""sorry, 🙄 sort it paramount",2022-03-26 10:58:33,1
"Won't be extending after trial! The app works just fine, casting works just fine for me too. For 6.99 a month I'd expect a fairly decent library of films & shows but at the moment it's quite small.

Additionally this app unlike many other streaming apps does not have a skip intro button.",2022-05-03 05:12:32,2

On top of that I subscribed for paramount plus and I had to subscribe separately for sports as well to watch a match but it didn't work when I want it to.

I missed the entire game and even after it finished I couldn't watch it. So sad. Other apps with football like Bein, 10 play, and Optus Sports all work very well.",2022-03-20 20:50:56,1
I live in a no service area my only form of entertainment is through downloading shows and movie on the streaming apps when in service and then watching them while at home. Paramount is by far the most problematic streaming platform I have used. Not only does it have trouble downloading whilst I have good quality service but when I get home and try to watch the downloads it glitches and frezez and has errors. I have yet to watch a full episode or movie.,2023-02-08 20:08:39,1
Really enjoying the content Very frustrating that it only sometimes keeps your place when you need to stop it part way through something. Also annoying that you cannot see the episodes in a season without searching for your show and bringing it up that way. This should all be in the one place. This would make the app great.,2022-06-17 21:54:31,3
"The app isn't available on the xbox in Ireland. There isn't any skip button for the into or for the next episode. Sometimes things take ages to load. I enjoy having some old nickelodeon shows on it, but it would be nice to be able to have the app on the xbox. Until then, my rating will stay at 3 stars",2022-07-31 09:22:44,3
"Great content, but this app is terrible. Plugging or unplugging the device while watching a show pauses the episode and then immediately plays the previous (or second last) episode from the beginning. Sometimes episodes begin playing from the last few minutes. Adding in profiles would be really useful as not all household members like the same content. Fixing app issues and continuously adding more content is a sure fire way to get a 5/5",2021-10-08 11:10:24,2
"This app is shocking. No matter what video quality is set on, nothing will load properly. I can't even stream a single episode. Glad I cancelled the subscription, I'm sticking to Disney plus. And please don't tell me to go to the support page - i don't need the same generic content you have left for every other bad review of this platform. Instead try fixing the bugs and issues EVERYONE is verbalising as highly problematic.",2022-03-26 08:34:02,1
"Absolute waste of time. I've been waiting for this service for a long time and when it finally launched today I was excited to sign up, only to be faced with incomplete series. It just doesn't make sense for a streaming service to have series that start at season 6 or even 12 because you want to be able to watch something from start to finish.",2022-06-22 10:08:12,1
"I'll give it a 3 because it works, but the fact I can't watch this on anything I own other than a mobile device is pathetic, no LGTV app, No xbox app, no casting unless I own a chromecast! Honestly, the launch of this service at least in my country is embarrassing, watched the first episode of Halo on my tiny phone screen! So in short, if I don't have an app on something else by the time my 30 day trial is up, I definitely won't be subscribed. Poor show paramount.",2022-08-20 11:12:40,3
"Excellent in everything. With the recent updates they have improved a lot and the interface is more beautiful and functional. It doesn't close on any of my devices. Its menus are clear and the icons they are understandable. My kids love it and we are happy for it. Hopefully the app stays at that level. As for the content, very good for us, what does not interest us, because we do not see it.",2022-08-14 15:15:37,5
"App is terribly slow, will not load half the time. Online also is very glitchy. My recommendation is to find a different software developer like whoever uses Netflix because the more shows you add to this will only cause this to get worse.

"The app is no longer working for me. I can download and watch but I can't just watch anything. I've force stopped, I've deleted and reinstalled, rebooted my phone and my WiFi modem and I still get an error message. I can still watch on my television but not the phone. Very frustrating to say the least. As a result I've changed the star rating. It's a shame as there are a lot of great shows to watch, just not on my phone.",2022-11-14 10:09:55,2
"Very buggy application. You cant watch more than a screen at the time. If you pause for too long, itll go back to subscribe to watch so u gotta kill that app. Clear the cache and launch from scratch. Itll often jam like latency through, cache gets built up, the u gotta kill the app, clear the cache and launch from scratch. Trouble to log in due to authentication server going to us version instead of Canadian overall, not a pleasant experience at all. And subtitle... lots of work to be done.",2020-08-26 04:47:51,1

There literally was no option through them?!!!",2022-04-26 20:15:50,1
Poor service have paid for a yearly subscription but can't even use it due to it coming up with error 6100. Followed all the tips in the help section to no avail. This is on the mobile app. When I have put in a complaint or issue it get the same help advice I have a ready done so seems automated. Never any follow up email to say it's working.

"Using the app for a phone or tablet viewing is great however as none of my TVs support the paramount+ App and as I have a years subscription it does seem unfair that they saw fit to put a mirroring block so I am unable to watch on a TV is somewhat despicable as they should not make an app available for only certain products unlike Netflix and Prime App that are widely available.

Exellence at it's finest. This sets the bar for the quality experience I look for in entertainment. The ease of casting to my Chromecast Ultra the 4K quality and clarity of the uninterrupted picture whilst streaming and casting to said Chromecast the sound quality is great as is the quality of Paramount + originals especially compared to a certain long standing British streaming service's awful originals. In all Paramount + is in my top 3 up there equal to Netflix and Disney + great work!,2023-02-18 07:13:38,5

The app NEVER remembers the episode or season you were up to after closing. Every time I use the app it has last played episode always season 10 episode 6 of the show I am watching so have to remember and manually select the season then episode and skip to where I was up to last time. Also minimises full screen on laptop when episode ends. Very frustrating",2022-06-02 09:28:23,2

"While most of the basic features are there for a streaming service , the option to change your download storage between internal and external is missing. So if you want to use your SD card's extra space, you're out of luck. This is disappointing as not everyone has enough headroom to keep their video content internal and need to use external. Instead of replying with yet another copy-paste response though, it may be better to actually fix these issues many users are having and update the app.",2022-09-16 21:01:43,2
"When this app was CBS All Access it was awesome for current and old content I had it for years worked great as a app. Now it switched to Paramount + I was hoping it even get better but unfortunately it's horrible content was cut shortly after the switch.

This is such a primative app and service when you compare to all others available. The fact it is limits to just dolby 5.1 and HD only is laughable. Surely there is no reasone other than money given that all other services are 4K. It also misses basic functions such as skip titles or next episode.

As a work around, I was still able to Chromecast via a web browser on my PC so it's just the mobile app that is broken.

I'm disappointed in myself for subscribing for so long to watch the football season, but now that it's over I don't think I'll come back. I have no faith in them improving the service . You can only watch live, or a replay when the game is over. Casting is problematic. Highlights always struggle for the first 20-30 seconds, so you've got to hope nothing of note happens in that time because you can't see it properly. It is shocking.",2023-06-03 22:55:25,1

Insanely difficult to cancel subscription. I know Netflix and Amazon make it tricky but this is on another level. You shouldn't have to look up a guide...

Good luck to anyone who wishes to cancel their subscription 🤞,2023-03-03 21:29:14,1

Is not a bad Start for the app but it don't have enough content old or new. Needs way more content and quick if not I think people will lose interest quickly.

An update review as the the app is improving and the content is getting better.,2022-11-11 18:57:04,5
Not the biggest selection yet but it will be growing overtime and the stuff that they are showing is stuff that I love so that's all that matters to me oh yeah and the price it's rock bottom and it's awesome! totally affordable and well worth it. I'd recommend this channel to anyone looking for a laugh or a movie to sit back to and have a night with the kids.

THEYVE FIXED IT! Or the way I manipulated the app did.... I've had it crash and reset my recent watched data about ten times which is fine I only have mild short term memory loss from mass amounts of weed smoked BUT when I have to BREAK THE APP in order to watch my shows that's a bit ridiculous.

"Some of the Programs are good especially south park but i wish they did something about skipping the titles. Maybe its different on ther devices but on my tv i need to come out of watching program and then find the next one rather than being able to skip like in everyother app, like netflix for example.

Barely works I'm using oled TV it tells me that video can't play outside of my country.. (doesn't even make sense) 50/50 at best it will work. All streaming apps work on my TV so I tried on series x and phone.. Its trash on all 3 won't be renewed once my month is up. Shame because paramount can afford to make a strong app its made cheap by design and it shows. Shows it owns are uploaded elsewhere earlier aswell it's like a month behind on its own content so pointless . Don't buy will regret it.,2022-07-31 04:28:47,1
"App doesn't even work and is completely useless. There is no smart TV app. Application won't allow me to cast to my smart TV. Issue is only with this specific app as I've casted multiple devices to my TV using any other app. To make things worse, I've posted a negative review because this clearly isn't worth anywhere near 60 dollars per year, and the review was immediately deleted. Maybe try fixing these issues rather than covering up how bad they are.",2022-04-29 18:02:04,1

Well Prime and Netflix. I love Halo, Man who fell to Earth, Dexter New blood, Super Pumped is very good, how factual it is, not sure. The series are very good, films are OK, sorry Disney have you there. Seeing as it is currently the cheapest streaming service what's not to like. Try it for a month 👍🏼.",2022-08-01 22:19:40,5

Good shows bad app. Can't adjust to fit screen so get small image with big border. When watching a series you download to watch it doesn't play the next episode from downloads but from streaming so you end up using data. Months have gone by and still not sorted this app. Playback is terrible and it doesn't play full screen.,2023-02-11 13:50:25,1
"I've been loving the app for the past 2 months (signed up for a year). The only reason I signed up was because I'm a huge fan of Criminal Minds, and knew that it would be streaming exclusively on Paramount +, when it returned this month. Sadly, I just found out that this won't happen in Canada. I'm very disappointed about this. As well, I received an email about renewing my subscription right now to save 50%. However, when I try to take advantage of this promo, I don't have an option to do so",2022-11-26 03:00:19,3
"The app continuously pauses and buffers or tells me I have no internet connection. This is happening every 10 mins or so, if I can get a show to start at all. VERY frustrating. Some great shows and movies to watch, if I could. I should be refunded for this month, I haven't been able to watch anything.",2022-09-18 07:25:40,2

"Generally I like, but there is some things that really drive me crazy, for example the change of idioms, the tool does not appear while watching the video, and even if you choose english, the episode/movie still plays in spanish, plz solve it, I use it to practice language, that's why I paid for this service, to watch series and learn at the same time.",2021-09-25 05:22:09,3
"The app is alright, but the service has barely anything interesting to offer, especially when it comes to movies.",2023-11-27 11:36:46,4
"App notifications for subscription offers are fake. Supooet is useless, I've filed 2 support tickets, provided screenshots, and received no guidance. Could also do with a skip intro button. In reply to the developer comment: I've filed 2 tickets. Why would I file another one for the same experience? Will someone suddenly start replying to me?",2023-01-10 19:39:54,1
Avoid purchasing this streaming service. They lure you knowing that it has an auto renewal and make it next to impossible to opt out of auto renewal. This has to be done only through the play store and there is no option to stop auto renewal I have been able to find. The play store is just as useless as Paramount in my opinion. Will be changing my devices to apple in the very near future at least with apple you can actually get someone in the phone to assist you instead of being ran in circles and achieving nothing.,2022-01-18 03:39:29,1
"Content good, app is so bad it's not worth it!! Main screen skips about at will. It never remembers what you were watching so shows like Fraiser with many series you need to remember the episode and where you were in the episode. Player is stable but media buttons on headsets don't work. If the signal drops it crashes. So going from wifi to 5g means reloading the show it forgot you were watching. Get a phone call n it crashes again. Just wait another year n see if it gets better.",2023-10-28 15:29:00,1

although there is a hell of alot of bad reviews for this app constantly buffering I have not had 1 problem with it. the reason I gave it a 4 star as mentioned it would be nice the same with other apps to be able to skip the episode of a series or skip the intro rather than skipping 10 seconds but overall for $8.99 aud a month there's no complaints about buffering from me. I'm watching on a Samsung s10,2022-02-14 11:18:02,4
"The app itself is terrible: logs you out constantly so you have to log back in, the search isnt great and you cant search by actor, it doesn't always remember you were watching something so you have to skip back through to your place. Also the range isnt that exciting, and a lot of it is on other apps. I don't know why every company has to make their own streaming service these days, it's getting ridiculous",2021-09-29 04:21:42,1

Called help line as per response below, they told me to contact Google Play. 220827 finally got a subscription after many emails. No option to start from beginning. Sometimes on rewind, it just jumps ahead to where I was rewinding from. Can only skip back, 10 secs each, to rewind. still no fix.",2023-04-01 01:50:32,2
"The whole service is terrible. Whenever I try to play a kid's show in the kid's profile, I get an error message that the content is age restricted. I'm talking titles like Blaze and the Monster Machines and Bubble Guppies (shows for toddlers). I contacted customer support and nothing changed. The kids no longer want to use the app. When I went to the States to visit my family, the app said Paramount+ wasn't available in that region. I don't think I will be renewing my subscription.",2022-12-18 01:45:10,1
"The streaming is smooth. It lacks a couple features Netflix has. Mainly, it is hard to browse a list of episodes in any given series. And making a ""play list"" of shows isn't a thing. You can't create a ""watch list"" which would be nice. Unless finding thease features is merely obscure.",2021-08-16 00:31:40,4
"Well they don't give you the option of half stars. I got a free sub with my purchase of a Roku and added the app for my chromecast. Would be a nice app if anything worked! If you can manage to get it to open correctly, then you have a 50/50 chance of getting an episode to stream. Of course that episode has to be there, and that is iffy at best. Case in point: there are 20+ seasons of Gunsmoke, yet there are only 2 on here and not complete seasons either. Oh, the Roku app is just as bad. Shame",2019-01-30 23:55:47,1
horrible app. had it for 2 days and now it wont play videos freezes up the phone if I even try and keeps giving me notifications when I'm on the app that I need to be connected to the internet.

Windows login also works on Ver 10 or 11, and Fire TV Stick work but not Android fails!",2023-06-28 19:48:58,1
"This is, hands down, the worst streaming app I have ever encountered. While every other streaming app I use will happily cast to a smart tv, this app refuses to connect to anything other than a Google Chromecast. Even then, you can expect regular buffering and connection dropouts. Unfortunately it's the only option for watching (parts of) the A-League this season. I'd uninstall it and demand my money back if there were any other options at all. I'll unsubscribe as soon as I possibly can. Awful.",2021-12-18 08:26:49,1
"Please force your developers to use HBO Max, Prime Video, Apple TV+ and Netflix because it seems that they don't know what a good streaming app should do and how its supposed to work.

Worst streaming app by far",2023-03-07 13:55:40,2

Get some other stream service , not worth it.",2023-04-07 10:56:34,1
The App is ok. The fact you can't view a preview of a show/movie works against it. I watch the football a lot. It's a shame it takes so long for highlights/mini matches to be available. I live in hope there will be improvements as I'm considering cancelling my subscription.,2022-05-27 12:28:32,3

Almost bought the annual subscription and if the app functioned well, I would have.",2023-05-03 20:22:59,2
I like the shows that are on the app but the video quality doesn't seem to change no matter what setting I put it on so it eats up a lot of data when streaming. When I cast to my chrome cast the app doesn't remember where I left off so that sucks and I wish you could have multiple user profiles,2022-07-04 04:23:41,2
"Terrible app. Wouldn't recognize my location or even allow me to enable location. Kept saying it wasn't supported for my country.

This app just doesn't work.",2023-09-10 17:35:59,1
"Worse than you can imagine. I tried to use this on Google chromecast, it never worked.

Please please please do not waste your hard earned money on this broken, garbage app.",2024-03-17 01:13:08,1
I love the content but the actual app isn't Great. You are unable to minimise while using it so you can't use your phone. It's hard to find highlights to the football and it dowsb not go in to a full screen mode so you can still see all your normal Samsung option buttons...my friends say this is the same on an iPhone too...bother streaming service I have used have this problem and it needs it be fixed if I am to keep it....oh and it's impossible to download on it too,2023-01-31 03:40:40,3

While online the app seems to work pretty well but soon as you watch downloaded content in flight mode it starts to be very glitchy. The video after a period of time around 10 minutes. The video starts to jump and stutter. The only way to fix it is to shutdown the app and restart it and hopefully it's remembered where you were but it doesn't always.

No parity in content between USA and UK despite all being owned by paramount. Cancelled free trial. Save your money! It's junk and probably needs another 12 months in development.",2022-06-26 13:08:00,1
The app and service is immature at present. When used in offline mode the offline content will start to stutter within 30 mins for no apparent reason. Restarting the app works around the problem for another while. The content isn't corrupt as it can replay the stuttered section happily after a restart. It also can't handle the idea you'd use it for a return flight. If you accidentally online it in another country will log you out and deny you access so you can't enjoy P+ on the flight home.,2022-07-26 17:14:07,2

I like the choice of shows Paramount Plus has but it is missing a few films such as the first three Scary Movies (they only have the fourth one). I also found out that it only has seasons 4 and 3 of Peppa Pig and that is outrageous! Also there should be more profile pics. Except for that though it is a good way to access Nickelodeon shows and cartoons. It also allows access to all 26 seasons of South Park.,2023-04-09 05:18:17,3

"I am absolutely disgusted with how hard you make it to cancel a subscription. It amazes me how quick and easy it is to sign up for your service and download and sign in on any device... but when I want to cancel because you have no good programs and ruined your chances with halo... i have to go on a scavenger hunt for multiple devices and follow a dozen different steps to stop giving you money for a service I haven't used , because it's garbage. I hope your company goes bankrupt.",2023-03-28 18:03:38,1
"The app was great at first, but for some reason whatever I'm watching keeps freezing whether I'm watching as streaming or downloaded. Very annoying indeed. I must be on the latest version as no updates are available and I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling with no improvement. The choice of viewings are fantastic but u watchable due to the freezing issue. Needs sorting ASAP.",2022-10-08 15:38:16,2
"Good selection of movies and TV shows, but the app could be improved. Many little bugs make the experience a little less pleasant. One example is when you're watching a show, and when it is changing to the next episode, we receive a notification that it is not possible to watch this episode due to technical difficulties. It happens constantly.",2023-09-12 07:50:48,3
"Horrible.. Had an issue with a too many streams issue when trying to move on to the next episode. Had 1 account, 2 profiles and 2 devices. Contacted support who didn't bother actually reading the issue, and proceeded to temp cancel my trial, then reinstate. When I next logged in, there was an entirely different email address linked to my profile. I figured out myself that the error was linked to the auto play function in the app. This needs corrected by the devs, and an update pushed out. Horrid",2023-01-17 12:22:23,1
"Subscribed for paramount on my tv because we saw certain shows my partner and I wanted to watch. Did a whole year subscription because of it, and after watching a couple seasons, we find out the shows we were interested in arent available anymore, We had to contact them to see why and that was the only way we had an idea why they disappeared. They couldnt even send a courtesy email to their clients regarding the what shows aren't expiring. They could even display it on the app itself.",2021-08-01 16:34:57,1
"I installed this app on my smart tv last night. I couldn't get any sound at all from it. So googled it and it reckoned to update it. So I uninstalled it and reinstalled it, and still no sound. Backed out and tried another streaming service. Volume is fine. To call this app a disappointment is being polite.",2023-07-26 21:27:18,1
The download feature needs some work. Downloads skip (audio and visual out of sync) and then every second file gets a 'Fatal Error' and it will no longer play.

"No pause feature for live sport. This is standard in so many other services. It is incredible that we're in the second season of A-league and this still has not been added. Why has this not been prioritised? It's very frustrating, especially for people with children. I miss large chunks of games or entire matches because of the lack of live pause and the ability to watch games on delay.",2022-12-16 10:34:26,1

"Seems pretty decent and they have south park so I'm thrilled however the customer support doesn't work and the send feedback sends you to apps that you, well wouldn't get feedback from.

This is aweful...,2023-01-25 04:45:34,1

And using the continue watching thing that is mandatory and works everywhere else, always throws me in at the credits of the episode i am on and haven't watched yet.

"Not great. The selection of shows in my opinion isn't great. Only show I really watch is South Park. There isn't an app for my modern LG tv, not in the UK at least. This means I can only watch shows on my tablet or phone. It has an icon to mirror the show from the mobile app but will not allow me to actually mirror the show.

Don't get me started on parental controls, very counter intuitive function, kids profiles got the pin control to switch, this is provided that it's always kept on kids profile. If a parent watches and leave the app, next person who launches the app can go in to a adult profile. Really silly.",2022-11-26 08:38:48,3

My only issue is that I went to sign in through the actual website it says incorrect password. Tried sending a password reset link to my email several times now and I have no email for the last hour. The app works no problem on my tablet and phone. I am getting very frustrated. And also not happy about half the shows missing on the app. The website has so much more. Also like to add that the app is for Canada not for USA as I just went to the Canadian CBS all access site and I got through.,2020-08-26 01:21:31,2
The application is horrible. I can't setup anything on this app. It is extremely basic with absolutely no features. The format in which it is displayed really makes you question why did I subscribe.

would be so amazing if it would cast to the tv properly. I was only able to watch 2 shows then stopped work8ng again. Tried to fix it the way I did before with no luck. Very annoying. My free trial sucked. So why pay if not able to cast? Who wants to hold their phone or device the whole time it watch on smaller screen. Unless you make it free,2019-05-25 00:59:27,2
Little disappointed there aren't more shows from the paramount network. Now they bump the price to $9.99 there is no where near enough content to pay this. I cancelled right away.

I've only installed Paramount because of Star Trek but have found some other shows I quite enjoy.

Want the app to be available on smart TV's... was really excited when I found out paramount were streaming their own content... but then no app to use it unless you pay for it within yet another added expense of prime or Apple tv.

Is there any sign of a stand alone app for smart TV's coming soon?,2022-08-30 12:32:48,1

Awfull app. And your tool bar doesnt disapear when full screen on android devices. Its like youve looked at netflix and gone nope we want an awful app,2022-10-07 15:55:23,1
Video plays at what looks like 420p on this app. Every other streaming app works but this one. Please improve this. Thank you.,2023-11-13 18:31:25,1
"Absolutely horrendous. You will be watching pixels. Doesn't matter how fast your connection is. You can leave something to load as long as you like, it will still be the worst quality viewing experience. It will stop working, glitch, throw errors. Google this app and look at the Reddit forums and you will know they are aware of how bad it is. It's been like this for years and has never been fixed. They just want your money, unsubscribe now, we are being ripped off.",2024-03-15 23:29:04,1
"Can't watch it on my TV, can't watch it on my phone. It either gets stuck on the loading screen or it tells me the TV show is currently unavailable.

"Be careful , don't use this app , if you happen to change phone or upgrade TV it's impossible to cancel, I've changed devices and no longer have the device I signed up with so the app won't let me cancel , it keeps saying go back to the original device you set up on , I no longer have it , I will be disputing and cancelling with my bank , way to much hassle, avoid avoid avoid , netflix stan binge disney , way easier to unsubscribe and subscribe when desired or can afford",2023-10-06 02:36:40,1
"I could only use it for a bit. When I closed the app and then tried to open it a couple of hours later, it kept showing a black screen. Also the tv app is not available for some models of LG tv, that's something Netflix, HBO max, prime video and Disney+ do much better",2023-03-26 08:13:54,2
"Im trying to watch Seal Team, once new episode starts it stops and tells me i have no internet connection, there is nothing wrong with my connection, happens every eposode, i have to retry 6-7 times very irritating, Netflix and Disney plus work just fine no issues, so i know its not my internet, you have refused my email on this matter, very disapointed, a bad review is all your going to get until this issue is resolved!!",2019-12-15 08:41:40,1
Do not recommend. I was in the middle of watching a show and they removed it from their service without warning. It's not even a new month and there was no heads up. There's not a lot to choose from anyways in Canada and this is just ridiculous. I am canceling my subscription and seeing how it's only day 3 of new billing I want my money back. What a waste!!!!,2021-07-31 00:05:22,1
"First impressions, it's actually very good, nice UI, easy to use and video playback and quality is very good. It would be better if you had more details on each movie or TV show such as a more detailed synopsis, information on video and audio formats etc. At the moment I have no idea if the program is HD, UHD, SD or HDR and no clue what the audio format is. Lastly the playback, there is no video preview on fast forward or rewind most streaming video apps have this. Fix and the app is complete.",2022-06-25 14:42:28,4
"Not bad content, needs much better app abilities. No way to cast to a TV or control the TV app from your phone? That's basic in other apps. Also, serious bugs with skipping intros and skipping end scenes that play during show credits. Needs working options for this. Needs serious improvement.",2022-11-03 00:38:11,1
"Absolutely frustrating. The app now refuses to continue to stream the next episodes of any show. I have rebooted Chromecast, force stopped the app, uninstalled the app all to no avail. Watching an episode and the next glitch of jumping to the next episode half way through the episode before. Seriously, no wonder you're going broke!",2023-08-03 13:35:37,1
"The app is filled with bugs. So far before I can even watch a programme I have to force close and clear all data from the app and reopen it,if not it gets stuck on the logo screen.

I am getting this error on both my phone and tablet apps, the browser version seems to be working fine. Edit: They don't even let you watch shows in your browser on a mobile device, it just redirects to the Google Play store. If you get this error you have to use a laptop/desktop computer. Annoying.",2022-12-18 23:14:42,1
I am genuinely upset. I used this for 1 day and I was very happy because this was the only place I could watch charmed. Now its telling me that I can't watch because I'm not connected to wifi when I am connected. Every other streaming service is working just fine but this one is struggling with the wifi. I would use this service just to watch charmed but since it doesn't work I'll just have to keep looking for other places to watch it.,2019-01-13 00:19:18,1
"On the tv app, it constantly drops the episode connection, having to rewatch scenes entirely when resuming play. On the phone app, it constantly cuts the episode and begins playing the next episode in the season. If it wasn't for the content of this platform I would not be subscribing.",2023-01-16 21:11:17,1
Worst streaming service app out there. Only reason I'm paying 5.99 is so I can finish wathching a show that I was watching on Prime which is now only available here. App is stuck on a certain episode and I have to skip episodes 1 by 1 to get to the one I want cause for some reason you can't choose episodes on here. As soon as I'm don't my show I'm cancelling. Nothing else on here I want to watch. Other services are far better in app functionality and content.,2022-02-21 15:19:57,1
"I like it, it has some good content. The only concern I have is the casting function. It casts to my Chromecast no problem and plays whatever I want to watch but as soon as it starts to play the app crashes and won't stay open after that. So I can't pause or stop the video",2022-04-18 17:41:53,2

"I don't usually write reviews but this made me so frustrated. I downloaded episodes to watch offline, less than 1/10 through my downloaded content, less than 24 hours into the 30 days, the app shut down and said I need the internet to open it back up. Then what's the point of the download function? Customer service was entirely useless. I had to wipe everything to get storage so I could use an app that works as advertised.",2023-04-12 05:08:53,1
"There's no streaming service like Paramount. It's so garbage you cannot even use it. How am I supposed to watch the aleague when the game buffers every 5 seconds and then freezes, saying there's a connection problem? It's useless. You can't even rewind/fast forward the games. If you miss something, bad luck. Pathetic. Once the aleague is finished, I'm cancelling my subscription and never using paramount again. It's lucky we can't give negative stars, cause it doesn't deserve more than zero.",2022-02-20 07:55:59,1

Worst movie app iv used so far. Every time I close the app and open it again it tell me I have no Internet connection so I have to turn my device off and back on again.

"Dear Paramount, can you please please stop messing with the app? Or if you're going to mess with the app then at least allow customers to return the MyList page to how it was? The MyList page now has ""continue watching"" at the bottom - adding unnecessary clutter to a page which should be solely devoted to a viewer's watchlist- like on Disney+. If I want to go to ""continue watching' I can already do that on the front page. Paramount has great content, but the app is atrocious.",2023-07-10 06:09:48,1

"Doesnt allow you to manage your subscription on the app unless that's where you originally signed up to. I have to cancel my subscription because some genius thought it was smart to launch a streaming service in the uk and leave out an app for one of the biggest brands in the uk (LG).

What an embarrassing app. If the person who actually approved this app to have the CBS logo attached to it hasn't been fired or at the least sent to the mail room.... This is by far the worst app I have EVER had the misfortune of having to use. I pay to have access to this? I must be nuts! App works fine a couple of times then won't load properly. needs to be uninstalled then reinstalled to get a few uses then repeat. Terrible!!,2019-01-30 03:09:21,1
"Do not ever download this app. I am jumping through hoops trying to cancel my sub and I can't. It's not in a browser, not on the app on my phone, I can't do it through my TV where I initially installed it. They make canceling near impossible, just check our reddit and you'll see what I mean.

Have been using the Sony TV app and have always thourght they had not had the 5.1 surround yet but it came on the other day. Watch 1 and a half of a TV series and then could not get the suuroud working again. I think this is a fault on the app. Everything else is Okay. Looking forward to see weather we are going to get 4k at some point,2023-09-11 18:38:12,4
"Generally an ok App,But has some kinks. Using as an add-on with SKY.Its VERY glitchy.The 'searching/downloading' circle always pops up in the centre of the screen,this causes warnings to be shown at the top of the screen.When this happens the screen becomes even smaller due to the border fading in to it. The App works absolutely fine on my Phone.I can even skip credits, something not possible on SKY. Not much choice,Not many Shows & Films,some big well-known shows,but only very few.",2023-05-12 01:56:43,4
"Amazing app and definitely worth its cost even tho it's in its early stages as of July 2022, give it time but for those looking for those paramount shows and movies look no further 2023 update, sometimes the app randomly closes when it's opened but after reopening the app everything behaves. Watching TV series and noticed skipping the intro title isn't an option and would be helpful. Overall still enjoying the service as it improves over time. Please keep this the home of Star Trek",2023-07-03 20:17:49,4

Additionally, the PIN feature is stupid. You need a PIN to exit kids mode instead of to enter an adult profile. This means my son can close the app, open it again, and go into my profile without needing to enter a PIN.",2022-08-01 10:09:23,3
Take up to 30 seconds to get to the HD quality at the beginning of streaming. The app always start with subtitle on so you need to get into the menu to change it. If you pause the app.for 10 sec. or more at the start of an episode you get logged out then need to restart the app cuz the app tels you that you need to be in your country to stream the show. Some of the shows don't have the full seasons episodes... Even tho they are CBS exclusive... The only good thing is that I was on my free trial,2021-03-05 05:25:33,1

"STOPPED WORKING!!! Was OK until last Sunday (June 3rd). Now on Sony Google Play TV cannot get in no matter what. Reinstalled, cache clearing etc. Sony support tried for hours after my attempts failed. ""There is a Problem with your subscription"" error ! Review your Google Play subscription setting.... Was not purchased via Google but via computer. I can connect first time on two window computers no problems, access the account and nothing odd shown. Tried Samsung Tab A7 and it fails the same",2023-06-09 12:59:28,2
"What an absolute trainwreck of a streaming service. I bought a subscription mainly to watch Mayor of Kingstown and despite being halfway through the season, I now only see episodes 1 and 7 available to watch. Explanation from customer service alluded to ""licensing restrictions"" even though some episodes of the series remain available. Seemed like a vanilla response to something that's likely a platform issue. Beyond that, functionality isn't great, and playback often juttery. Not worth my time.",2022-04-03 01:10:54,1

I enjoy the content and selection but the app is buggy and frustrating to use. I keep getting messages saying this title isn't available in your country after watching the same show the night before on the same TV. Paramount needs to fix this app or lots of people will give up and cancel it!,2023-03-02 18:23:42,2

If you can be bothered signing in EVERY time you want to watch something, or when you pause something on Paramount+ for 10 minutes, and then have to search again every time for what you were already watching because there is no watchlist, this the app for you. Me, I just want to be able to watch so I will go back to my far less high maintenance streaming services. Content is okay but constant buffering I might as well be watching a scratched DVD",2021-09-25 23:43:16,1

So you cant search for help and you cant email. Tried the chatbot, it also doesnt have the answers and when you type Agent, like it says to, it sends you to the email form but the link doesnt work. They are worse than when google stared and didn't think customers needed help. Devs never read but commented",2022-11-28 21:54:46,1

At first I bought the monthly package payment to just watch the Transformers movies on there, but since they have all the star Treks on there, I upgraded to yearly subscription. I'm planning on watching all the star treks on there. Then to watch others on there, so it may take me two years to finish watching everything I need to finish.

You viewing pleasure goes like 5 sec of show 30 sec buffering, 5 sec show 30 sec buffering and it makes not difference if its download or streamed.

If I'm watching a TV series on my TV and then move to my mobile device, the last watched episode is the last one I watched on the device rather than the last one from the TV.

Don't do it. The app is glitchy. The instructions for cancellation of your subscription don't work. It just sends you round in circles.

I've just done a system update on my phone & this app is up to date too so I don't know what's happening.

The app is completely lacking compared to the tv app option tested on 4 devices from apple to android) From missing genres when searching on the app (onlyshows up to science fiction genre around 6+ more on TV) 2) Cc the go out of sync every episode 3) lag loading in the icons 4) The next episode skip only sometimes pops up 5) randomly sometimes it will tell u max devices reached even if there's only one viewer I could be better like TV ver",2023-09-01 05:39:22,1
I subscribed to paramount + but when I went to download the app on my samsung qled T.V (which is less then a year old I should add) it says there is no app for it. Beyond frustrating I do not want to cast from my phone that is why is purchased a $2000 4k smart television. Seems to be a problem that others are having when you Google it. I may just cancel my subscription.,2021-03-18 23:36:53,1

"Works fine, it has all the standard features for a streaming app. Only issue I've encountered is that sometimes a video or page takes a long time to load.

"When I originally signed up to the paramount app, it was through Google. But as there was no dedicated PS5 app, I unsubscribed from the Google play subscription and switched to paying through Amazon. I had no problems with the app, but I was under the apprehension that you could still access the app after confirming your amazon subscription on the paramount website.

At least 70% of the content has been removed from Paramount + and recent updates to the app make it almost non-functional.

Exactly the same thing happened on the return flight 😞 The app seems OK otherwise, but is completely unsuitable for viewing offline.",2022-09-23 03:01:06,3

Love the updated content but needs more. A piece of advice....Hire a new UX/UI designer. Whomever came up with your layout fire them. Oh man your layout is just really painful to scroll through and it just seems like the content is just there.

Can't believe Netflix is the only good app. This one doesn't even keep track of what episode your on and let you continue. Plus every single time I need to turn on the closed captions. Probably the worst streaming app out there. At least it has about six shows that are good.,2022-06-05 23:56:43,1
"While the are some good content, the app is lacking. You can not create multiple profiles, it does not accurately keep track of which episodes have been watched, when playing series it skips episodes and there is no feature to skip opening credits or recaps.

Don't get the app if you want to watch sport. It never quite loads properly abd you are left with a spinning blue circle in the middle of the screen. Something that doesn't happen on the advertisements you are forced to watch. No help given from support either.,2022-03-01 22:04:32,1
"I like it so far but definately needs some work. Not all shows show up even though they are shown, some are slow to load and have had a couple buffing issues here and there but not terrible.

I have been very excited to watch Strange New Worlds and Halo ever since they were announced and it is such a shame the app is spoiling my enjoyment of these shows by constantly buffering every couple of seconds making the shows unwatchable.

My review is for the Canadian version of the app much of the content available in the US is not available in Canada but there is no way to tell before purchasing the service which programming is available in Canada. I understand that some of their hit shows have been sold to other streaming services in Canada but even shows like the English version of younger! Which has been removed from Amazon prime Canada as well as Bell Canada's streaming service are not available on Paramount Plus.,2022-12-05 16:31:35,1
"I used Prime initially to watch Paramount plus but I took advantage of the black Friday offer and downloaded this app. App is nicely laid out but is missing some conveniences of similar streaming apps. Most importantly, not being able to play from where you left off after having closed the app is a huge pain. Please add this.",2022-11-24 12:20:57,3
Won't cast to tv - your response is as helpful as your support pages. As a programmer and IT consultant I shouldn't find it as difficult as it is.

"This app is underdeveloped & very underwhelming First of all i subscribed for one show EVIL & it's a paramount plus exclusive, but because Canadians don't deserve the full experience. 2nd thing is if you're watching on phone. It's going to be squeezed square inside your screen with no way of expanding it. If you want to enable subtitles good like with squinting to get them. Finally, 90% of the shows are on Amazon Prime. It's not worth the 7 days experience. May e one show ""tell me a story""",2021-11-28 12:56:34,1

"The app is poor to say the least. Slapped together in order to start making a buck. On my android box there is no way to change seasons so I have to use the website. On the site, streaming on demand football was showing in low res so as to make a game unwatchable. There are so many streaming sites that they could take examples from but this smacks of a school project. Just beggars belief that a multi-national, multi-million dollar company could stuff this up so much.",2022-04-06 09:40:51,1

Absolutely horrible. Thank god I only got the trial. I will canceling this subscription. The app doesn't work. I can't even click on a movie or show without the app closing. I have closed and opened it a dozen times even with wifi or data. Fix your app!,2022-03-28 06:00:14,1
"Glad to see I'm not the only one with a problum cos i hate complaining but.... I only pay for the service for 1 series and I am willing to pay full for that one series but I am constantly having a bad time with everything from the app not starting or just closing down or saying half way through episodes sorry video not available outside your country shuts down and restarts, frustration to the Max.now I know sth park is available elsewhere I have now completely cancelled.

"Warning for anyone else living in the UK and Ireland who wanted to try the recent release. Most of the content advertised on this service is not available. Because apparently they were either too lazy, didn't care and rushed it out any to try and make more money faster. They launched it incomplete and paying for it now means you're getting scammed out of content that should have been included. Do not buy it. At least not until they add the rest of it.",2022-06-26 22:56:42,1
"Unacceptable for a paid service. The menu is slow and at some times unresponsive, video quality is sub par with a great deal number of artifacts. With a little more time this app could be great. Hope they figure it out in the near future.",2022-01-31 04:35:12,1

Poor experience for sports. If a match is in progress you can only watch live - not from the start and there is no warning that you are being thrown into the middle of a game. Once it Is playing full screen live you can't go back to the main menu and you need to shut the app,2021-11-28 05:58:55,2

"Why is this not and when will there be an App to install on the TV. I have an LG LED UHD Smart TV and both Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Apps are available and installed on it, fully working. The is no Paramount+ App to be found in the LG Content Store despite these other two (and a whole collection of alternative Streaming Service Apps) being available to install. As far as the alternative source Google Play Store, there is a Paramount+ App but is only downloadable for my Mobile Phone so is irrelevant. Is the plan for the Paramount+ App only to be available for installing on Mobile Phones and so I assume to be viewed by Screen Sharing with the SmartTV? If so this is entirely unacceptable and quite frankly pointless. Until there is an actual Paramount+ App to download and install on my LG LED UHD Smart TV (and all other modern Smart TVs) it is pointless and best left disregarded as an unrequired, uninstallable ""feature"". When will you be making the Paramount+ App available in the LG Content Store and all other relevant ""Content Stores"" available for all other brands of TV instead of only on Mobile Phones?",2021-08-22 06:16:14,1

The Android tv app is not working. It won't play any movie or show when I click on the watch now button. Your tech support page is also having its own technical issues. When I try to submit a ticket it keeps on reporting submit failure messages. The whole service is a mess right now.,2022-05-05 15:35:47,1

This will be my second review of the day I would suggest just avoiding this app until they sort out its issues was just watching a series and suddenly the whole first season except episode one has vanished the other 3 seasons are still there but that's useless without the whole first season that was there less than 20 minutes before typing this just seems to be issue after issue I'm UK based so it's new here bugs to be expected anyone outside UK may have better experience so try it yourself 1st,2022-09-30 07:42:27,1

"Good, but could be improved. Lack of intro skip is annoying, and I've noticed some newer shows have started bringing back the ""previously on...."" which is nothing to do with the app, it's the studio, but this means with no skip function it gets tedious trying to guess and slid until you get to the start of the show.",2023-02-05 18:44:22,4

If you are Canadian do not get the subscription yet. The service won't let you play things unless you are watching it on your mobile phone. App on tv will give a .. outside your company error message... This renders the app useless. You will have to clear cache and data each time and re-log in. You can't even pause it without this error happening. :'(,2021-03-29 03:46:17,1

Poor selection and interface and Paramount really thinks this is acceptable they could have partnered with Amazon or Netflix instead of trying to pull whatever this is .... Also I love that they respond to even partially nice reviews but not one response to the negative ones save your money and find it for free online it's not hard and Paramount doesn't deserve your money for this app and service,2021-12-27 09:54:49,1

It's fine. But can't use the app on ps4 as it doesn't exist on the store like netflix or disney or prime. The system doesn't seem to recognise earbuds to pause so it just keeps going. If in travel it demands high quality data. Like disney. It's fine. Needs work,2023-06-28 07:42:26,2

Who ever designed this app obviously has never used it. Its really annoying. Your logged in and you select a show. It the asked you who's watching so you log in again and select your show again. You forget your password. You follow the email link. It doesn't give you the option to reset the password but instead takes back to the app which you now have access to. Great. You now select your show and it asked to to login by resetting your password. You see how the mindf loop continues. Well done,2023-01-30 08:04:29,1

Amazon prime other then the boys it's have lots of boring shows. NowTV is over priced If paramount add more TV and movies I won't need no other streaming service.",2022-06-22 09:27:18,4
"Waited a while to do this review to see how the app ran over time. As others have said, it cuts out a lot. I'll be half way through and it'll stop playing. I also can't seem to get subtitles to work which is difficult for me. I also can't set up personal profiles, I want separate profiles for each family member but can't figure out a way to make it happen. I also hate that there is no ""list"". I can't add things to watch later? Seems a bit of an oversight.",2021-08-16 06:00:18,1
"The app could use some work sometimes my downloaded shows start to ""stutter"" to the point where I have to restart the app but that also is problematic as you have to open and fully close the app around three times for it to have the paramount + splash screen and actually load its contents.",2022-09-27 16:02:55,3

"There is absolutely no point in subscribing to Paramount Plus in Canada. From what I hear its not bad in the States but in Canada there is next to nothing available and everything that is, you can get on Prime. I subscribed to watch Sealteam and you can't get any of the new season at all. Even their top show Yellowstone isn't on there. You have to go to Prime for that. It is not worth it.",2021-11-23 12:11:43,1

The content is OK....the functionality of the app is bad. It rarely remembers where you have paused or stopped the movie. The fast forward or rewind is often not shown properly. This is both on the phone and Sheild.,2023-08-15 10:59:32,2
Good effort However. Dubbing works only in their respective country. What if I travel to another country all dubbing disappears. Dubbing should be manual in list too. 2. Streaming data should be 240 or 340 etc too for data saving. No Korean content or enough dubbings. Great effort though,2023-07-05 11:51:56,4

Not too bad a few issues with loading and the fast forward and rewind functions are slow and a bit out dated as can't see where you are and can crash from time to time but overall not bad considering the length of time the streaming service has been around defo better than Disney,2023-06-10 00:33:02,4
The mobile app needs work. It doesn't remember what you've been watching unless you cast. The search and browse functions are both very bare bones. Definitely not nearly as well laid out or functional as other streaming apps.,2023-09-26 08:07:07,3

So far the app doesnt seem to track my shows that I am currently watching and doesn't display them to continue when I next open the app, I need to remember wich Episode I left of or keep track of the Timestamp if I was watching a movie. In short: I am missing many quality of life features that I know of other streaming services and ones you should expect of an app of a concern the size of yours",2023-09-24 12:04:27,3

Their support centre don't even read the emails sent as requested full refund and generic email just batted back....WHAT a waste of money and I didn't even subscribe for a full year. Looks like I won't get my £69.90 back despite requesting a full refund. TERRIBLE App don't bother subscribing,2023-04-02 10:10:26,1

Sucks. I downloaded this because when I searched big brother US this came up. I finish the download process and sign up (which you have to do to search through the shows) and come to find not a single season is available! So misleading...

Also, why isn't there an option to for a mini video window/player so I can still watch whilst looking at another app? Poor form for this app and business, why would I pay for it?

When they do manage to show it the english commentary is so low you can't hear, the crowd noise is on burst ear drum mode and then 3 other commentators will come in half way in the background on different networks in 3 different languages at volume 1000",2022-07-20 23:46:58,1
"A Modest Start with a very good selection of Material to watch, and I must say there is a level of quality in the production of shows, im not looking for another Netflix and This Paramount+ App honestly offers just that, a breath of fresh air, in time when the app improves im sure this will be a go to for most. Well done.",2022-12-07 06:06:41,4
Requires way to much data and is constantly buffering. Fix that and be a good app. As is it ate all my data up at a extremely high rate even on the lowest quality settings and the buffering because of the data use makes it annoying,2021-12-31 17:02:39,1
"Horrible experience! The app is slow, same shows you can't fully watch because for some series they ask you to upgrade the account, and the worst part, they give me 7 days free trial and charged me on 5th day!!! When i was clearly thinking not to continue with the app, now i dont get even my refund!!",2023-05-27 10:47:36,1
Good selection great sale price but app interface is slow clunky hard to navigate and seems unfinished. Recommendations seem random at best not really related to program catagories and the about section is a few bland text lines. But for 50% off for 3 months it's good,2022-07-11 00:09:44,3
Doesn't work on Amazon Firestick. Doesn't auto play next episode when watching a series and seems to have some weird glitch where it doesn't end the episode you just watched and says you have too many simultaneous streams playing.,2023-02-01 01:02:42,1
It's a pretty decent app so far. I'm glad they added South Park but I'm waiting for other series like ridiculousness to be added as well. I hope that eventually it will become as big as Disney plus as I enjoy paramount movies and their TV networks alot more! Can't wait to see what's in store for paramount plus in the future!,2022-04-15 18:07:39,3
"Not a bad selection for Canada if you like CSi stuff, but why is there no favorite tab for shows? You have continue watching which you can't get rid of if you don't like the show. This is on the Roku format and a lot of episodes are missing on some complete series.",2019-12-09 17:18:51,2
I'm in Canada and didn't had acces to big brother now I don't have access to the old season of the challenge. I want to know if I will be able to watch the new all stars season. If not I'm starting to wonder why I'm paying for that app. Pls reply with info. Thank you Edit obviously I never get an answer and now the new show the challenge USA is starting but I cannot acces to this either?? All the shows I'm paying to see are not accessible in Canada. Paramount plus you suck!,2022-07-07 02:11:33,1
"Not a bad service, the app gives continuous high battery use warnings and the service as a whole seems to buffer alot even on higher speed connections. Decent selection but their app needs alot of work.",2021-10-25 07:32:49,3
"Selection is 4 But the app is sooo basic. Does not remember where you were last at. Cannot skip intros. Navigating shows and movies is akward. App needs work yo. Seriously? I ain't having errors, your app sucks stupid. Reduced to 1 star because of stupid reply from developer.",2022-04-30 20:58:17,1
"The APP need more work. Quality election for content is not available, information of the movie have no tech details like quality available. The settings sections is lack of many features, like the subtitles look and feel. In average the player need a lot of work. Keep going better please",2021-03-06 21:31:47,2
Service is laggy. Video is always pausing/buffering. It's not my internet as I can stream uninterruped on another service simultaneously from the same device.. I will not keep this service but may reconsider if the situation improves in the future.,2023-08-18 01:19:56,2
"Pretty meh experience for watching the A-League. Technical issues are far too common, STILL no pause and rewind (after a year and a half of telling us ""its coming soon""), and matches/highlights take too long to be uploaded. Inadequate service for what we're paying for",2022-12-26 08:48:11,2
"Terrible app, iforgot my password and there is a major fault in the password reset email. It just does not work. Unbelievable. I emailed help desk 2 days ago, still haven't heard back. I luckily remembered my password so i could watch star trek.But actually the worst streaming app i have used. Paramont should be ashamed. Such an old and prestigious media company really need to be better.",2023-06-16 11:37:57,1
"Can't sign in and ""reset password"" email is not that at all. Digi marketing need to check their automated comms. By time it's fixed my 7 day free try of App will be up. Extremely disappointing start after such good advertising to join. What a waste for Paramount+ and what a shame for me!!!!",2023-08-08 03:50:52,2
"Cannot unsubsidized through the website, app, or on TV. I been subscribed to this service even tho I messaged many times about it. I now have to goto my bank and tell then to block/remove paramount. They pretty much tell you oh well when you mention it. They g8ve you the same directions website, TV, and app give.",2022-12-31 10:26:39,1
"Poor at keeping track of what I have watched. The continue watching section has got stuck on episodes I watched 2 weeks ago even though I have watched later episodes. problem is across multiple platforms. Also when I go to the episode guide, not showing which episodes I have watched",2022-09-22 19:13:09,3
"Love the customizable subtitles. 3 stars bc I can't waitch downloaded shows on my phone, and the app crashes frequently. However, watching this service on my Roku Tv makes it a seamless enjoyable streaming service.",2023-03-24 04:24:38,3
Got the app to watch the a-league. Watched one game and was probably the most painful experience of my life. Constantly lagging and buffering. No connection problems as live sports of other apps work fine. Please give foxtel the a-league back.,2021-11-21 07:07:09,1
"This is the worst streaming service ever. Tried watching the new Yellowstone, 4-5 minutes ads every 10 or so minutes. Can't forward through them, same 3 shows repeating for 2 and a half hours. Gonna cancel this service, obviously they don't care about customers, only money and trying to force their few shows on a person.",2021-11-08 02:18:07,1
"I have been using it fine but recently I continue to get a ""input error"". I have uninstalled/reinstalled, I have force-stopped the app, nothing seems to work! Please help! Thank you! I have already tried to contact paramount plus online with no help from there customer service system.",2023-04-25 21:45:51,1
The app is a a pain to find things and refer back to your own saved favourites. The queueing with episodes seems to be random and not by the order listed. Should allow users to sort playlists by preference.,2022-03-06 08:18:52,2
Really delighted that Paramount+ has come to Ireland but the app is very limited in function. At the very least it needs a 'continue watching' function. I find it difficult to justify a subscription currently.,2022-07-25 21:03:28,2
"First week my A-League streaming experience was fine, this week the games have been almost unwatchable with how often it's lagging and pausing to catch up and then missing game time. Won't be renewing my monthly membership unless there's a big improvement.",2021-11-28 05:22:31,1
I want to cancel as it's not what I thought it would be. I do not want to continue. I downloaded this 5 minutes ago and opted for the monthly fee after the 7 days free trial. But I no longer want to continue. Please cancel my membership. I thought it was a music app. I did not realise it was movies.,2023-02-19 04:56:29,1
To say this app is only partially complete would do it justice.... I've used alpha programs that are more stable than this crash festival.... the longest I've managed to watch anything is maybe 10 mins before I get an error message..... I don't know what happened... did the development team just up and quit 3 days in?,2022-07-15 08:19:24,2
Offers the subscription to Canadians but does not offer content. Essentially went to cbs online to look at star trek got big pop up ad on the startrek discovery page stating welcome Canada you can now get cbs online. Signed up downloaded app searched and nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not new series or old. Waste of time. Now just need to figure out cancellation. (Likely they have agreements across Canada for various IP and can not show in app but shady business practices to say the least),2019-11-30 05:33:45,1
"Unable to expand to full screen in Android 12, unlike other streaming service apps. Other streaming apps increase screen brightness and disable adaptive screen brightness on android devices. Can be a bit clunky to use when compared to your competitors.",2022-05-27 02:45:22,3
"good selection for my taste. however some HD episodes dont play audio, I've tried everything i could think of and everything Google suggested and nothing has worked. so that kinda cuts my selection in half....",2019-05-16 00:59:32,2
"The subtitles are difficult/impossible to change. The Good Wife - season2, episode 13. It is literally impossible to change the subtitles to English. This includes the app from Google and on Roku.",2022-12-18 00:57:54,2
"Great content and works pretty well on Android TV. But, UI could be improved to make it smoother, and it desperately needs 4K / Dolby Atmos etc to keep up with the premium streamers and do its library justice.",2023-02-15 00:21:52,3
"Downloaded this app, but won't be continuing my subscription past the first free week. It skips episodes of shows and the amount it buffers is crazy, it's very annoying. Definitely not worth it which is too bad.",2022-06-05 19:41:18,1
"Show's Don't restart from beginning after being fully played, Very frustrating. Also often has connection issues with Chromecast, specifically doesn't like it when you start to play on mobile device before trying to cast to screen.",2022-01-19 06:02:47,1

"Doesn't even record what you last watched most of the time, it used to. Now, you watch a series, it's saying you haven't even watched an episode. Also crashes a lot. Quite a waste of time now. Edit: Got a response from paramount saying how happy they are I enjoy the app... Not sure they read these.",2023-08-03 21:50:32,1
Love the shows on the app but again like everyone else is saying it's hard to watch a show plus the app is not showing up on the PS4 store even though it's saying on Google it is available for the PS4 also I guess because it's still fairly new to Canada we don't get what america gets because I want to watch shows from Nickelodeon as well not just sitcoms from the 80s and 90s,2021-05-23 19:02:45,2
"This is a streaming service??? There is 42 tv shows and 49 movies and there mostly old. Why would anyone pay for this compared to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+I really don't know. I am missing something on the app where the rest of the service is?????",2021-10-29 04:14:11,1
"It is absolutely so difficult just to UNSUBSCRIBE from this app. There is no option to cancel my subscription on either my phone app account or TV app, nor Google play store. It's a huge regret that I downloaded this app an created an account with paramount + most majority of their movies won't play either.",2023-03-27 11:09:47,1
"Great streaming service & app. Easy to use app, can create a profile and add programmes to a watch list. Also has a continue watching row. Great range of series already with more being added day by day.I really like this streaming service and app so far!",2022-08-05 18:34:13,5
the one reason I got this was for star trek discovery. it has no shows worth watching i was a waist. But the other movies and shows I found were worth it. Also Netflix pissed me off by cancelling all the good shows and keeping the worst shows ever made. It seems all the other apps including this one have ended Netflix. And Dave Chappelle should know Netflix turned into a bad app. They should never have cancelled the Santa Clarita diet. And many other good shows that were worth watching.,2022-06-13 17:32:27,4
"App crashes too much, I download a lot of shows to watch when travelling and at times app won't load as I don't have an internet connection. Very frustrating app to use and hope they update soon to fix the issues.",2022-10-13 11:45:08,3
"Impossible to reset password . The app and reset email Just has you going round and round in circles. They content on paramount is brilliant, But I can't watch it tonight as it's impossible to reset password. You click on the reset password link and it Just opens the app as normal to ask for your Original password Which is dumb.so you click reset password and round and round we go. Update: You can only reset password on their actual website on a computer or iPad.",2023-04-22 19:21:15,3
"Very glitchy, once a show or film is downloaded you can't watch offline which seems pointless downloading in the first place. Good choices of films and the app is user friendly.",2022-12-12 11:49:52,3
"I signed up for about two months but have been waiting to cancel but it won't let me. When i search how too, it clearly tells me how too! But the option isnt even there. So im assuming theyll just be leaching money out of my account. There support assistance isnt even getting back to me, so id say its pretty much scammy and scrumy atm. Do not recommend anyone subscribing right now! They tell me to go to support.paramountplus for assistance but its an automated response and with no resolve",2022-06-30 01:37:20,1
Congratulations on screwing A League fans. This is the worst app I have ever used for sports. Can't pause or rewind. Match replays are not available until a day later. Paramount will be responsible for the downfall of Football in Australia. Learn something from Optus and Bein Sports. Even Stan Sports do a better job.,2021-12-27 01:59:55,1

"Can't change password and link they give you just goes back to front page. Very poor app and now have lost ""my list"". The app is getting worse each update. Can't open when joined through Google. Highly don't recommend to anyone",2023-05-18 05:55:00,1
I wanted to cancel my account but I literally can't. I have tried via the subscriptions screen but it will not let me select the month by month option to cancel. In addition it seems as if the Android app is not connected to their website. Please let me cancel my account.,2023-03-10 22:13:37,1
"Garbage, misleading app designed to make cancelling a free trial and subscription as hard as possible. It will not allow me to cancel my subscription at all, from any of my logged in devices (phone, browser or streaming media player), instead incessantly prompting me to cancel from the device I used first. Uninstalled! Will never subscribe again and if Paramount bills my credit card I will report this misleading scam attempt to consumer affairs and ensure my bank reverses the subscription fee.",2022-01-27 02:27:50,1

"Awful. So much for a free trial, I couldn't use it and there's a lot of programmes I would have liked to have watched. No screen mirroring and for some reason Paramount does not work on Samsung TVs. By the look of other reviews just simple watching on your phone/tablet has many issues. Cancelling.",2022-07-29 19:50:28,1

"FANTASTIC content. So many shows and movies that I love from childhood that my kids can now experience. The only bad thing is the app constantly shuts down. If this was fixed I'd give it 5 stars. Much better than Foxtel, Netflix, Prime etc.. and much cheaper too! Well worth it.",2021-10-20 23:33:52,4
App needs a lot of work. It can't distinguish between downloaded and non downloaded episodes. Downloaded videos stutter and freeze. Lately I have to sign in every time I open the app. Don't get me wrong I love the content but the app needs work.,2021-09-21 09:56:44,3
"Could've been a 5 star. If only the Dev would do a simple fix to enable a full screen zoom, this app has a great potential. I watched more on my phone, and the lack of ability to zoom in and use all of my phone screen limit my viewing experience. Hope they will fix this.",2021-11-15 16:20:19,3

Quite poor app experience compared to Netflix and Stan. Main issue is that you can't choose what episode of a series to watch. If you swap between two devices it doesn't keep track of where you are up to and you need to manually skip through episodes to find the one you are up too.,2021-10-13 10:16:06,2
"Tried to sign up, just got an error with no explanation for why it wouldn't work. Edit: I was able to finally get logged into an account, I wanted to see what they had available for live tv but they only had some weird alt right propaganda show. Didnt see the grammys anywhere like they advertised.",2021-03-15 20:45:18,1

Issues with streaming also tends to skip to next episode rather than just stopping. I dont have the same issues with your competitors. No support for LG TV's Can only use on an Amazon tablet if you buy via Amazon. Until you improve these issues I won't be continuing after my free trial.,2022-12-30 23:06:06,1
"Total junk. Canada beware! They take my money fast enough, but I can't download the app on more than one device and the service is buggy. In Canada we don't have access to all shows (even though it is a pay service) because of a monopoly on some programs by Bell. I will cancel my subscription - not that they care.",2021-04-04 14:46:52,1
"The navigation is terrible compared to Netflix. Can't skip intro's or episodes, you have to go all the way back to the title to select the next episode. ""continue watching"" should be at the top as soon as you open the app.",2021-12-26 02:10:55,1
Updated review: you've finally made an app for LG TV! I have signed up directly with you now there's no need to go through Amazon Prime video now. Needs some work but it's not bad and am enjoying the content. Please bring premium subscription access to the UK. Standard is as high as I can go atm.,2023-08-17 14:33:49,5
"So i think its fair to say that in over six month's not much has happened except that now some episodes seem to disappear for a few days... and suddenly reappear, it goes without saying that this is not limited to a single device but happens across all of them! As there is no sign of 4k and 3d surround my original Review still applies. Bonus question: why has STSNW season 2 no 5.1? (Season 1 has 5.1)",2023-07-24 14:17:46,1
"Not a fan of the fact you can only have one profile so the wife and I have to keep an eye on where we are at. Commercials showed a lot more options and Canada side is very slim pickings.

"Really laggy, episodes have extra credits and horrible long beep at the end of some. Gets stuck on the credits and no option to skip to next episode. Lots of room for improvement. A lot of what is on here is already on Netflix or Nowtv",2022-11-13 11:55:38,3
"As of right now I literally can't use it. When I logged into my iPad to watch, it wouldn't let me watch, it says I had to pay. Than on here it logged me out, log back in. I have to pay, but it won't let me even if I wanted to buy the same stuff twice? Idk....this is just stupid....what a broken app....I honestly hope that this company contacts the people having this issue and gives us a month free or something?",2022-09-03 00:27:26,1

"It's OK. It is simple, straight forward. It has no navigation between episodes while watching. You need to exit out and search the show again then enter and go to the next episode. I would recommend putting a next/previous episode option, or show an option to list episodes.",2021-07-03 05:53:27,3
"Well.... every time I use the app it either freezes, crashes with many glitches. Annoying problems that make streaming unpleasant.

Keeps stopping and starting similar to Disney+ did. Very frustrating when trying to watch something. Other than that the app is well set up and has a great selection of shows and films to watch.,2022-07-02 10:35:56,4
This app needs a lot of work on the functionality side of things. Doesn't remember where you are up to in a series. Has played episodes out of order. No continue watching section. No search history. Every other streaming app has these features.,2022-03-15 02:00:46,1

"Rather buggy on nvidia shield 2017. Doesn't allow you to select next episode, or watch credits when it comes up at the end of each episode when watching a series. Also has problems saving from last watch. None of these problems happen on Roku Express. Please fix.",2023-06-25 07:42:33,2
I am very disappointed with this app. I subscribe for CBS so I can watch a show which the site said I could watch if I subscribed. The show was not there. On top of the that the app worked for maybe 2 days tops then never opened again. Everytime I try to open the app it closes right away. Please fix this.,2020-11-28 17:46:44,1

Worst streaming up experience of 5 apps I tried. I downloaded 4 films for my trip to Japan only for the app not to work in an other country. It then used 4gb of data overseas despite not being able to access the content. Upon getting back to Australia the app couldn't cast to a chrome cast.,2023-01-23 09:53:07,1

DOES NOT PLAY EPISODES IN ORDER! Constantly skipping episodes then skipping back. Making it frustrating to watch any type of series. Small selection in comparison to the others like netflix and stan.

"The app is broken, everytime I use it I have to sign in. It crashes alot and the web be version is even worst you can't even pick the show you want to watch for example season 1 episode 3 that's none existing on the web browser version.

For a company like paramount this is by far embarrassing to use I don't know how the executive at Paramount feel about this mediocre app",2021-09-28 21:52:50,1
This app is terrible! Paramount is the only streaming service that wont play videos smoothly. I can't stream downloads offline because there is constant disruptions and it's like trying to watch a scratched DVD. Very frustrating and I will not be continuing my subscription.,2021-12-16 13:20:51,1
"Not bad, clunky with no skip intro or skip to next. More stars when you make an app for Xbox, like every other streaming service has... you cost me additional funds for Roku, even though Xbox Game Pass gave me a free month it didn't cover that cost. Disappointing 😞",2022-09-23 23:24:54,1

Beware that pricing may vary between the app and the web. Black Friday had 50% off via web but not on app. I had play credit that I would have used.

Hopefully Paramount adds more content and makes it worth the money.",2022-02-11 15:44:14,2

Pretty good experience overall. I'm quite surprised at how fluid and responsive the app is... I suppose I went in with low expectations and I've been treated to a much more pleasant use scenario because of that.,2022-04-29 02:43:53,4

"Movie/series selection is not great. When searching actor's name to show their movies it doesn't show. When you click the TV show to show episodes, it just plays the same episode instead leading to episode list. Not worth the hassle & led me to cancel subscription.",2023-01-27 22:36:23,2
Allows android menu bar to be seen across the bottom on Android devices (I have a Samsung S7tab) incredibly annoying and keeps you from being drawn into the streaming experience. This is the only app that does this. Needs an update!,2023-02-19 03:36:07,2
Update: This is still the worst app on the market! Their customer service is just as bad! After doing everything they recommended the app still doesn't work but now their customer service team has ghosted me! This is the worst app on the market. It does not load on the phone. The app on the Samsung TV won't play anything. What a joke!,2022-12-12 00:50:54,1
Keeps stalling. It takes 3 hours to watch an hour show. Constant buffering. Thought it was my internet but Netflix works fine. This app is CRapp. Only suffering through it to watch the prequel to Yellowstone....1883 otherwise not interested in keeping it.,2021-12-26 02:37:43,1

App is terrible. Constant you can't watch this outside of your country despite it being the TV that's bolted to the wall so it hasn't moved. Should be able to watch on 3 devices has a meltdown trying to watch on 2. Paramount sort you app out it's just bad.....,2023-03-08 21:37:09,1
"Not very intuitive, the app on the TV is not as user friendly on the phone and whole seasons are missing. Disappointing that streaming services still engage in geoblocking content, they wonder why pirating is continuing to be used.

Subscribed specifically for Criminal Minds but it's not on here. I'm not sure if it's because I live in Canada but it doesn't say anywhere that Paramount Canada wouldn't have Criminal Minds. Also very small selection. Only 49 movies and 42 shows. Worth it if they have what you want but not worth it for me. Definitely unsubscribing.,2021-11-05 06:58:35,1
"This app is a great value for watching commercial-free TV without subscribing to cable. It has a lot of variety of programs both current and past including classic favorites like The Love Boat and The Brady Bunch.

"Not alot of movies/ shows to choose from. Also I keep selecting a movie and it keeps telling me it's not available, not just once, it keeps happening. Keeps getting out of the app top. I'll keep for the month but o think I'll unsubscribe after that",2022-02-12 07:03:23,2
"Great App! Short on content still, but very good so far! My only issue is (yet it ain't worth knocking a star off) that I have a big phone, and the App won't let me expand the image to fit the screen. And it isn't included as an App in my samsung TV! Hope you can fix that soon!",2022-05-27 23:26:30,5
"Right now it's now working on any device, and I've cleared cache and force stopped and re installed the app app, and still getting error, no code of what error, just error, now I enjoy this app as it happens to have many of my shows to enjoy, but will cancel service and go with another streaming service if this continues.",2022-11-14 05:05:11,1
I have been trying to cancel my Paramount subscription with no luck at all! It's been going on for over 2 weeks now. I have tried everything! (like a few other people have said here on the reviews there's no cancel link.) I keep getting the same emails as well. We're working on it. Here's how to do it. So frustrating.,2023-01-11 18:36:42,1
Only allows 1 screen viewing. Any time I try to watch on my phone a error comes up. So not available for all screens as claims. Overall do not plan to renew subscription in the future. Garbage app with very few things to actually watch.,2023-05-14 05:28:10,1
"Where do I start.. firstly, paramount has invested over 80 million in the A League, and is now the so called home of football. I subscribed and paid the full annual fee, only to discover there is no way of watching it on my TV (an lg). I then try to watch it on my laptop (its sooo good watching football on a laptop!), only to find that the streaming quality is from 20 years ago! Utterly unwatchable.",2021-11-22 08:02:26,1
"Wait until you try and cancel your subscription then can't because of dead links on their t&c page then no ""cancel"" section in the app, then misleading instructions on their Google page. Waiting for people to give up ! And the content /programmes on offer was not that good.",2023-02-27 09:21:28,1
"Pretty basic streaming app. Annoying how long it takes Paramount to upload ALeague replays, also annoying it doesn't let you stream a live match from the start or rewind - even Kayo can manage that, and it's a pretty rubbish app too. Optus Sport the benchmark for football streaming apps in Oz.",2021-12-27 11:57:09,2
"Useless. Shows that are available are mostly old. I forgot what my password is so I'm trying the forgot password option, it takes me into the app into my payment details, very useful, not. If I then try to watch via google it spits me into the app and I just get a black screen, it does nothing. Thank God I'm still in my 1 week free trial period. Looks like I won't be continuing my trial",2022-08-29 07:37:59,1
"Terrible App. This app is not worth it at all, it spends more time stopping and buffering then actually working. I have great WiFi at my house and zero streaming issues with any other service! Very glad I cancelled this before it charged me because it's pretty much unusable.",2022-03-04 11:44:24,1
Pretty good selection. But I can't play download content with out logging in after a reboot of my tablet. It's problematic when there's no wifi connection like on a plane.,2023-01-26 03:46:30,3
"I just got this streaming service because of South Park and I couldn't see any episode of the 25th season, don't know why but the episodes never charged, even in my Samsung TV.

"Don't know why people are having problems ? I've also joined Paramount+ just for the A league, logged in for the very first time 5 minutes before the game and was pleased to see the vision of the ground and all the supporters, then the game started right on time. Even enjoyed the new commentator team My only complaint, the transmission seemed to be in HD but not Full HD, hopefully Paramount+ comes to party on this, especially since Amazon Prime has up to 4K resolution for less money.",2021-11-24 07:41:53,4
This app tells you to try a free 7 day trial and you can cancel at any time but there is no way to cancel it!! I have searched everywhere and even tried to look up support but get nowhere! I want to cancel before I start getting charged!,2022-01-22 13:19:29,1
Oof! This app is terrible! I tried watching a show on my mobile. The app crashed. Tried again. Got an error message. Tried in browser. Sends me right back to the app. Tried once more. My phone crashed. Thank god for the free trial period. Not gonna pay for that bad of a service!,2023-03-09 06:19:09,1
"Needs improvement! Playback pauses every few minutes to buffer. Other streaming apps rarely have this happen (i.e. less than 1 per month!). Also, not a lot of content, but hoping they will add more soon. Not really worth the subscription fee. Will probably cancel soon.",2021-05-17 21:46:02,2
"Very buggy and freezes up often, compatibility with smart TV's is questionable. Also completely freezes when trying to skip back 10 seconds on mobile, and upon restarting the app, it freezes, requiring multiple restarts. Needs an update to fix a lot",2022-06-25 23:57:39,2
Content is good. App is terrible. Doesn't remember what shows I have played is slow to connect to Chromecast. Home screen doesn't show suggestions based on viewing history.,2022-03-29 18:37:58,2
"Missing features you would expect, especially if subscribing for A-League. like 'Pause' ability, Like a Sport category to make it easy to find the A-League.

"I want to unsubscribe and it won't let me. On the app (account section) it says change to monthly or annual subscription. No cancelation. On the website it tells me to go to the app if I want to to change my subscription. I want to cancel it, there is nothing on Paramount+ for me to watch.",2022-07-08 11:12:33,2
Content is great but connecting can be frustrating. I constantly have to clear the app chache or restart my casting device for it to work. I don't have to do this with other streaming apps. Buffering can be slow at times.,2022-04-24 11:20:49,3
We are supposed to have 2 screens at the same time but as long second person try to watch there is an error that too many screens is active. I tried to contact customer support and got ignored. Planing to go different way soon because this is super annoying.,2023-05-31 23:01:37,1
"Intermittent service If we could rate the app based on content alone then it would have 5 stars. Unfortunately, I have to in lude conenet. It is very hard to watch anything. Your app just gives up part way through and shuts itself down.",2023-01-19 14:58:28,3
"Good content, rubbish controls The videos are played as a small rectangle on your screen. Using 50% of it only. There are no settings to zoom to full screen, and changing the video quality does absolutely nothing.",2022-08-08 07:13:23,3

"Any plan for Paramount to fix the bad audio is its too low On my 3 TV and on my 2 google tv . Other streaming app I cant pass the volume 9 or it gets to loud, while Paramount I go 15 and more and yet the audio isn't as clear. I DID SOME RESEARCHS and apparently I'm not the only one , who's been experiencing that since 2020",2023-04-06 21:22:30,1

"Great selection for a lot of different categories id been searching for an app that caters specifically to my personal preferences #Horror, #Action, #Psychological Thrillers. Also have the odd happy, or comically funny even in Cartoon. So I highly recommend this App. There's something for everyone (I believe so anyway)",2022-02-06 00:52:39,5
The mobile app was great. Did 80% of my viewing on it. But now It will not work on my phone or any of my friends' phones. It just freezes on the logo screen. I will change my rating when it works again.,2023-04-14 04:44:07,2
"Very happy with this service. Got some content that I haven't already seen, picture quality is good (on my OLED)) Easy to navigate, good value and no contract. Prefer this to Netflix as there isn't all the foreign nonsense to wade through (although there are a few gems hidden there)",2022-08-08 13:49:44,5
Everytime I try and search a particular show it just shows a blank screen. It's the only show I want to watch but can't get to it. There are improvements that could be made to make the platform a bit smoother and easie to use.,2021-11-21 09:33:01,2
"A good app, though it has a tendency to play up when opening the app. Downloads can be an issue to view if you don't have phone reception. This defeats the point of a download.",2023-05-02 19:54:52,4
"It'll play but plays episodes out of order, it gets very frustrating. It'll play one or two in order then skip to some random episode 2 seasons behind or ahead. Always skips to the same few episodes too.",2018-11-22 06:51:37,2
"Paramount + has got some good content and great originals, unfortunately the app is not intuitive and it takes forever to load in both my Samsung Smart TV or my Galaxy S20. Internet is good enough to run all the other streaming services in full HD and yet the Paramount + content cannot load in any quality.",2022-05-13 04:31:50,2
Great quality app easy to use and some excellent programs and films to watch I would say there is something for everyone. But I also think there could be more movie & TV series choice. But all in all 5 star 🌟 from me,2022-08-03 19:14:44,5
Worked fine until recent monthly renewal payment. Still loads as normal but when I click on any program in any channel it attempts to load but comes up with the message that an error has occurred and to try again later. Live news full of US stories irrelevant to Australia. News stories provided by CBSN and while the titles are shown the stories will not load. Something went drastically wrong with this streaming service around the time of my recent renewal payment. Feel I have been scammed.,2021-10-05 11:12:52,1
"Same thing as everyone else, always gives an error message, on the phone, on the tv.... If I can find were to watch Star Trek I will definitely switch, this app is always down. I've cleaned up cookies, cache, uninstalled and installed back, contacted support, and nothing works.....always 👎 down",2023-04-26 19:09:38,1
"These guys are late to the game. Content is pretty limited (though the Star Trek series are great!). App functionality is temperamental, even worse than Disney. Go for the free trial the drop it like a rock.",2022-12-08 08:16:45,3
"Unbelievable. There's no support for this app, zero, just look how they don't even care to answer bad reviews. I was waiting to watch Dexter New Blood and the subtitles are totally out of time. The only new show they offer and they still fail like this. It was the same with other shows. Don't waste your time here, this service worth $0.99 at the most.",2021-11-08 23:27:31,1
Just doesn't work at times. Everything else works on chromecast v2 but just doesn't connect. Support page links on supported devices goes no where yet also says it supports all chromecast. If they had LG app this wouldn't be an issue.,2023-01-27 10:58:26,1
Good selection of shows. Only downfall is that the app will not play the next episode automatically. Instead it plays a random episode. Pretty annoying. Hopefully it will be fixed with an update,2021-11-06 04:14:30,3
"Horrible, ive been subscribed to paramount plus for almost a year i never use this service and im on a tight budget but they have made cancellation a nightmare.... i cant cancel it on google play like they keep asking me and they continue to send me on this endless loop on telling me to cancel on google play. But i literally can't.",2023-01-26 01:56:05,1
"All of a sudden I can't open it without receiving a message ""invalid input"". Have tried reinstalling, changing passwords, clearing cache. Have sent a message to Paramount plus help and hope they can resolve this soon. Most annoying. And to top it off, my downloads have vanished. Update: All fixed now, thank you Paramount 👍",2022-12-20 07:56:37,5
"Terrible user interface. Inability to pause, rewind or return to live action on a live stream is unbelievable, particularly due to the fact that there are so many other steaming services to follow.",2022-03-26 10:57:48,1
The content is fantastic yet the app is slow for instance you click on a tv series for instance and wait an age while the app brings up what a movie or tv series is about. For a major film studio to have an app sub standard as this is pretty poor. Apart from that pretty great. Start to fix the app pls.,2022-12-29 12:35:16,3
"Terrible app, can't pause or play live tv on delay. Casting barely works, via Google tv constantly has a buffering circle on live tv and each time you start a stream it plays an ad even though you are paying for the service. They need to lift their game big time. Not happy for a subscription service",2021-11-19 08:43:47,1
"EDIT: works again on my phone after 26 May update. Great streaming service for all things Star Trek! But other than that ST, smallish library. App itself is... okay... good enough to get to the content, but not like the UX standards set by Netflix.",2023-04-28 04:23:21,4
"Theres a workaround to the endless loading screen issue its a bit annoying but you can get into the app, you have to first go to the paramount plus website then click on a movie to play, once you click on the movie it should put you right into the app no loading screen.",2023-04-14 06:31:04,1
"Some good content. The issue I have is trying to cancel your ""free"" trial. Been on the app where I signed up and on the website and only have the option to chose subscription type. Just another greedy corporation.",2022-05-19 07:01:57,2
Only registered to watch Yellowjackets. There is a lack of variety of content available compared to the other leading streaming platforms. Not worth the price considering the lack of shows and movies available on the UK app.,2023-05-16 22:37:21,1
Good but needs work. It would be good if the video filled more of my screen (Galaxy S22 Ultra) and the option to skip intros or catch-ups. However the content is great and look forward to watching more.,2022-07-30 18:15:07,3
"Tried to cancel subscription under manage account and there is nothing to cancel using the device or smart TV. I was trying to cancel before the 7day trial was up. I emailed for assistance to cancel. Movies don't play on my smart TV, disappointing.",2023-04-07 08:42:56,1
"They have all Star Trek, only the app sucks so bad, it literally never works. And it's not just the app, I watch episodes on my PC and it does not appear on my continue watching afterwards, so pretty much useless. The whole Paramount experience is really, really bad.",2023-06-06 19:39:14,1

"Up until yesterday, I've had no trouble at all. I love the app, but then my continue watching section stopped updating!

"No option to just see movies or TV, no way to see the complete list of content, no genres, there is a menu option for Live TV which only has CBS News, content listing page loading is clunky, no kids profile, no trailers, reminds me of Foxtel in the 90s....by far the worst mobile streaming app.",2022-01-29 11:20:38,1
"Very disappointing, app is terrible. But gutted shows I wanted not available. Survivor and challenge not on here. Even the new trending programs one (halo and star trek ) every wednesday.. people dont want to watch tv series like that any more. Very disappointed . Thankfully cancel first 7 days.",2022-06-21 19:48:50,1
Let's be clear: they have star trek hostage. I'm willing to pay the £6.99 a month. Seem to respond to feedback. The main usability issue I'm having is that if you disconnect from WiFi then you get kicked out of your show instead of just buffering. Takes away from the experience.,2023-01-28 21:21:13,3
The app was working fine until today it is telling me I need internet access and I am connected. All other apps are working fine. Not something I will be willing to pay for if this problem is going to be ongoing. Love the shows though. There have more unusable days than days when this app is working properly. If it is not fixed soon I will be cancelling my subscription. Such a shame. Disappointed,2018-12-14 04:02:55,2
"Truly awful app. Literally can't cast without it freezing every few minutes, meaning we have to disconnect, cast again taking a minute or two each time. I have great internet too, so definitely the app.",2022-06-25 07:31:25,1
Frustrating....seems almost impossible for me to cancel my subscription. I've been back and fourth with the play store to cancel...because they won't actually allow you to cancel on their app....just get pushed around to someone else. Kinda ridiculous.,2023-06-07 01:19:01,1
"This app is still very much work in progress. Some features are missing such as skip episode, the watch progress is not saved across devices or sometimes its not saved at all...",2023-01-13 09:58:18,1

I have lots of problems loggin in and there are some movies it sinply won't reproduce. I tried asking for help at the contact they have. They sent an automated message with useless information and no longer respond. If you are going to pay for some streaming service this is my least recommended one.,2022-09-08 21:55:53,2

What were the head honchos of football in Australia thinking letting these amateurs take the licence?! Eye wateringly embarrassing! Can't rewind or start from beginning and replays take several hours to become available! Not to mention the quality issues! In 2022? Really??!!,2022-02-16 10:36:27,1
Liking the recent added series and movies. Only minor issues is when watching movies in the apps; it automatically shut down the apps and error application. Need to fix this or glitch. Moving forward its great 👍 👌,2022-05-30 15:45:12,5
"I would like to have a 'watchlist'. I tried to screenshot something to remember to watch later, but that's not aloud. Can you add a watch list? I see you have downloads, but I don't want to download everything I want to watch later. I love that you have an 'all movies' and 'all shows' section, that's one of my favourite things on Disney+. Are there going to be more Live TV channels? Thanks heaps :)",2021-08-10 22:48:35,4
"Very hard to cancel. Has been the past 45 minutes trying to you cancel my subscription and have given up. Only options under ""account"" are to upgrade to annual subs. Cannot cancel via the Paramount website. Cannot cancel in the app. A real waste of my day off",2022-07-04 02:36:56,2

"I never leave reviews but the selection is so awful and misrepresented, I don't want others to fall for this. First, incredibly small catalogue (46 titles in the show category and 53 movies. That is across all categories). Second, majority of movies are pre 2000s, so if you, like Paramount, believe cinema peaked pre-aughts, there probably still isn't anything for you because 53 movies is nothing.

Dreadful UX. Am up to episode 8 of a show but in the continue watching header it is halfway through episode two so every time I have to into search and find the show and then work out where I am up to. I see now that the show is on another platform so I have gone into the accounts section of the app and despite it saying manage your subscription you can't even leave the platform. You can only choose between monthly or annual. So now have to work out how to cancel subscription,2022-07-06 20:37:11,1

The paramount plus app is extremely poorly optimised. It runs absolutely horribly on my phone. It doesn't keep track of anything that you watch or where you got to in the current series or episode.,2023-08-16 23:49:26,1
The UI need some tweeks and there is some issues with the app itself as well. Dont know why one TV series always starts from only one point instead from last viewed moment. Keep working on it.,2023-08-09 21:16:38,1
"Why is it that it says you have certain shows, but when I open the ap to go and look for them, they aren't there? False advertisement. Also, the subtitles aren't accurate. There was one scene where a subtitle showed up but the characters in the scene never said that. Google says you have Young Sheldon season 6 but I don't see it. And why aren't any of your movies from the 90s on here? ""André"" the seal movie, ""Lassie"" movie from 1994.",2023-02-02 14:03:29,2
Terrible for a paid service. So many glitches and problems for a paid service. Pausing or in any way interacting with a show when it is playing causes a white grain to appear over the show and it is impossible to get rid of it without closing the app.,2023-07-01 17:50:58,1
Only just signed up to this which is free of charge through being an existing sky customer with the sky cinema package and so far I am enjoying being able to watch a series based of a game that I grew up playing and being able to download the show's and movies I enjoy to watch when not around WiFi and not use my data makes it even better so it's a 5 star from me look forward to more things that they might add to the app 10/10,2022-07-02 01:23:22,5
Pretty smooth app with a nice design. Continue watching function is abit ropey and my main gripe is no pinch to zoom on Android? I'm using a pixel 6 Pro to watch alot of content but it's letterboxed all round.,2022-07-25 19:27:31,2
"Great app I can watch all of Hawaii 50 on here. Only draw back is sometimes the app does not work oh and there is no second screen so if you want to look at your email the show turns off. But, more often than not it works.",2021-10-17 16:07:34,4
"Late to the streaming party and have managed to make a useless app. The content is woeful for Australia and the app reflects how terrible it is. No profiles, buggie interface and constant buffering even with excellent internet.",2021-09-19 09:31:31,2
"Off-line mode is broken, always searches for connection and if you manage to get it to play it starts freezing.may come back in the future if issue is fixed, until then not worth the frustration.",2022-09-05 08:29:43,2
The app on my phone works great 👍. On my Google chromecast not so well 👎. It's the Bluetooth connection with my speaker unit. The only way I can watch contents on the large screen of my TV is to cast it from my phone🙄🫤,2023-10-14 19:17:42,2
I haven't found much content on here I like so I have been trying to cancel my subscription. They don't make it easy and I have tried every way I can think of. Meanwhile my subscription is still being paid and unused. It's a great way to squeeze more money out of subscribers. I'm still trying to cancel it with no luck.,2022-08-13 20:45:54,2
"Can only watch sport matches in real time. Can't rewind any matches or go back to the beginning once they have already started. Replays are not available until 6 - 8 hours after the match has been played. Very poor broadcasting, kayo is 100 times a better product. Please forfeit the rights to A-league matches paramount, you are ruining the experience and making people pay for your shite coverage. Go away...",2023-01-10 10:37:35,1
"I have got paramount plus for the live A-league coverage that starts in October. I have enjoyed watching some oldies on here (NCIS anyone?) And their movie library is fairly decent. The one thing I don't enjoy is that I can set different profiles or add shows I like to a list, like you can in all other streaming services. Add this feature and it's 5 stars from me",2021-09-17 10:20:39,4
Used it for one episode and now the app keeps crashing. App will not open anymore. No lists or user profiles. Very small selection of content. Terrible interface. No LG app. Zero stars.,2021-10-13 23:21:54,1
"The app is getting the 5 star rating it deserves, as the problem with crashing has now been fixed 😁 Quantity is not always quality and this app definitely proves that. Of course they don't have as many shows as other streaming platforms, but compared to others, nearly all of the shows added on here are worth watching 😍",2023-10-28 15:54:23,5
Impossible to cancel you want to cancel netflix/Disney etc you simply log in to there sites simple not paramount even tho there the supplier you have to figure out where you signed up they can't tell you which is absolutely ridiculous they constantly attempt to take payment over and over and over you have been warned this needs there urgent attention a massive flaw I cancelled with my bank and multiple attempts have still been made disgusting,2022-12-18 11:58:37,1
"You never can't see something on this app, to play a movie or series can take up to 2 hours, an you have to deal with the app forco g to stop working, log out and log back in, restarting your phone AND STILL DOES NOT WORK. I will cancel NOW.",2022-05-21 23:57:57,1
Worst app ever. Always won't load technical difficulties. Won't play downloads or says their not their. Pauses all the time even in a download. Can't wait 2 discount it. Not on the app have 2 go find were I can stop it. Probably easier remove my card.,2022-01-24 07:40:45,1
About the worst user experience you could believe. Have to log in everytime I access the app on google TV. Goes back to season 1 when you go back an episode and so you have to remember what episode you were on or scroll through and read every description. If it wasn't for the fact that I'm lockdown watching ncis episodes I would cancel today!,2021-09-19 10:25:29,1
"It crashes all the time, and the downloaded content requires an internet connection to work. Very not user friendly and lacking features in its interface, completely incompatible with 2023.",2023-10-17 18:25:21,1
"Great content, bloody awful app. Every time I watch a single episode of anything the app just freezes up. The episode will pay, I go to play the next one and I have to exit & restart the app before I can do anything. Needss a serious fix",2023-09-01 00:32:36,2
Great App. A bit early to fully rate the content as we have only had for a week. So fay a very economical way to watch movies we have not seen. Hopefully content will stay current and cost will not go crazy like netflix.,2022-04-02 00:17:17,5
"Enjoying this app so far. There's a good variety of shows and some of the older shows I like too, like 'Cheers' :) The app runs smoothly and I haven't had any issues whatsoever. I'm happy with this service and I will continue to use it. Thanks Paramount+ :)",2022-11-11 19:39:09,5
Absolute garbage compared to other streaming apps . The majority of the time it doesn't remember what episode you are up to and doesn't have a option to select a specific episode from a series.,2022-02-27 10:21:53,1
"Content is decent but, on tablet the episodes of a show are really spaced far apart, compared to Netflix and Disney Plus. I am sure, over time, more content will be added, and that is great. Also, why are some episodes of Brady Bunch missing; musical episodes.",2022-01-12 03:24:18,3
This app crashes all the time. I have to constantly uninstall and reinstall. Buffers in a show or says it's experiencing technical difficulties. Not worth the money if the app is not fixed.,2022-01-18 02:39:55,1
"The app itself is terribly made, you have to look for the keep watching shows instead of having them at the top, when you tap on a show it plays without showing the info whether you tap on the play button or the image itself",2022-12-07 09:50:49,2
Does not like to be chromecast. When you so finally get it to work it plays on your phone a d TV at different times and you can not control the TV from your phone. Terrible app.,2022-06-14 10:11:16,1
"Edit: I can officially make this app 5 stars. They actually fixed the issues with the app that were throwing errors at me pretty quickly. All the shows on here are great. The movies are awesome. 10/10 to the devs and engineers that work on this app. Hopefully, it stays this good!",2023-03-28 20:24:01,5
"Overall is nice, although I can't change the language preferences which I hate, also I can't turn off the subtitles nor start a next episode automatically. There's a lot to improve",2023-04-05 21:16:12,2
There are a number of comments already posted regarding the fact that the app fails when closed and reopened. The casting function fails more than it works. These have been ongoing issues since latest update a month ago and no solution.,2018-10-19 03:47:51,1
"Paramount+ is my favourite streaming app. If for nothing else, Yellowstone, but the app is seriously packing interesting content. Might not be as loaded as Netflix, but it's all about quality. Love it. (Thanks for responding, made my day too. 🤗)",2023-01-20 22:58:32,5
"Navigation is not very easy, picture doesn't rotate when phone is vertical, no playback/rewind/pause options for live sport. Very basic functionality for a streaming service.",2022-04-12 11:04:36,2
"Shockingly bad support. Keep getting Resubscribe emails even though I've 6 months left on my subscription. All Support do is tell me to contact Google Pay instead - just because that happened to be my payment method and despite my account details being up to date & correct. Pure, shameless obfuscation and avoidance of responsibility.",2022-12-11 14:49:18,1
"Put shows behind and exclusive app without even adding the most basic user features... Profiles people... my wife and I don't have the same tastes inshows and when we do ... shockingly might watch them at different times... give up on this worthless app and wait for paramount to loose a pile of money, give up and finally hure someone that can copy any subscription service from 5 years ago ...",2022-02-20 09:17:27,1
Second review: Fa Cup final I paid to watch is still not on the app 10 hours later... First review: Don't waste your time with this terrible app. I tried to watch sports and they removed the game while I was watching. They also don't put the replay up untill about 2 hours. Contacted support and they said speak to google apps. Worst experience ever,2023-06-04 00:45:00,1
Content is good. But no skip intro button and this gets Annoying. It's also does not remember where you on when watching an episode on other devices. It can also be a bit glitchy,2022-07-18 17:24:03,3
"Terrible app. Not only does it not have basic functionality like every streaming service should have such as not even having a watch list, it doesn't even keep me signed in. I have to sign in every time I open the app. Fix your **** paramount.",2021-09-17 23:01:33,1
"Not too bad, but you definitely need to up your game with streaming to another device. Also 'skip intro' and 'next episode' buttons are necessary, because no one wants to watch the intro or credits when binging ;)",2022-02-17 13:40:22,3
Videos pause A LOT and sometimes the subtitles are on the side of the screen so you don't get complete sentences or they are ahead/behind. 😔 Will have to cancel. Stopped using the app because of the issues i mentiined.,2020-09-13 03:34:28,2
"When I try to watch the downloads in offline mode, the app refuses to start because there's no internet connection. I thought that was the whole point of a download option, to watch the downloads when there is no internet. Quite useless",2023-10-21 10:34:21,1
"I signed up specifically for ""Girl in the box"". I can play it on my phone but it won't play on my TV. There are a few other shows that won't play too. I keep getting 'something went wrong! Please try again later.' ?I've tried many times later and it still doesn't work.",2022-09-27 14:53:56,3
"After many, many emails, finally got the app to work on my phone. Still no luck with app on firestick. Won't let you sign in. Unless you're going to watch it on a phone or tablet, don't waste your money.",2022-03-12 03:40:04,2
The first couple of shows we whatched the volume was okay. Now we have to have the volume at max and we can only just hear the program. I've checked all the settings and I can't find anything that will sort it out.,2021-12-26 06:53:00,2
"The app is mostly good, but the inability for the app to update properly when you start a new episode of a show, and the app tells you that you still are on a previous episode, makes it more and more of a bothersome chore to find wherever you are at in any series. Just update where i am in the series based on the last episode that got played, please!",2022-07-24 07:37:23,3
"Absolutely awful streaming service. If it wasn't for the couple shows I wanted to watch and don't wish to pirate them I wouldn't get this. So many glitches, don't even try on a firestick 99.99% it won't work, just buffers every 30 seconds.",2022-02-07 03:48:02,1
"Worst streaming service of all, barely works on my phone, have to restart app at least twice. Does not work at all on fire stick or any other device. I'll be cancelling my subscription shortly.",2022-05-26 15:10:18,1
A lot of the time this doesn't get past the Paramount logo - it just freezes. If I back out and run it again - it freezes on a black screen. I have to force stop the app to get it to work.,2023-04-26 13:03:45,3
"mobile version doesn't work very well! but i download it on my roku streaming stick and it works perfect no problems at all i have it on my Amazon fire stick too,the only problem i have is how come criminal minds and other popular cbs shows arent on there? right p",2019-05-25 05:52:47,3
"Worst out of all online streaming apps... glitches all the time, can't download to extended memory, can't save shows to watch lists.. not really user friendly.. fix all that and I'll re subscribe otherwise I'll stick to the Netflixs stans and primes of the world",2021-08-19 08:11:02,1
Great selection. Just a couple of bugs. Sometimes it'll say too many people are streaming when I'm the only one using it. Or it won't play on wifi while my wife watches on the laptop,2023-07-28 15:40:50,5
half time doesn't want to stream to tv. Not a right good selection of films or anything it's definitely over priced for what you get. I'm cancelling it and removing the app it's the worst one brought out so far,2022-11-21 20:31:30,1
"I only have this app to watch the A league and am really disappointed that you don't have at least the basic functions that other apps do eg stop, pause, replay, watch live or start from the beginning.",2022-11-16 10:50:14,2
Doesn't have download/offline option. I like watching shows on my phone while commuting and don't want to use my mobile connection. Because of that this app is pretty much useless to me.,2019-03-13 14:04:32,1
It doesn't track how much you've seen or how far you've gotten into an episode. Sometimes even plays a whole other episode than the one you chose. Library is good but app is not worth using at all.,2022-04-16 22:37:54,1
"App really needs some work. Buffering issues but then it happens on my PC as well. In full screen, my pop up tabs stay active. Kind of annoying. I am enjoying the content though",2022-12-17 06:59:37,3
"The app is still super glitchy. Open it and it freezes.. try again same result over and over. Playing downloaded shows, same thing. Constant freeze ups. Considering canceling our subscription",2023-04-10 03:26:21,2
"Terrible - this is like an app from 5 years ago and it would have been terrible then. The key failing is the promise of streaming live TV. It's awful for the a league football. The interface is ghastly, honestly this makes those bad smart tv apps look good. Fail.",2022-02-09 10:47:42,1
"So far, so good, theres at least 3 series I'm hooked on where maybe I might find one or two I've found on other streaming channels, so no complaints here. Bringing this up to date nov 2022 i do have other streaming channels an i do rate this one of the top, i did have a few probs bk mths ago but these have put thereselves right more quality series so tip top.",2022-11-02 20:46:06,4
They kept bugging me for a review so here it is. 2 stars because they have some of my favourite shows. Lost a star because of content restrictions in Australia i.e. can't watch star trek day watched it on twitch. Lost another because they don't update content promptly. Lost a star because you are making me pay for this at least let me watch before it goes on TV,2023-02-19 23:23:45,2
"Many bugs, crashes often. Many titles are not available to download for offline viewing. Most titles, when viewed offline, crash frequently and need to be re-download.",2022-04-25 23:07:50,1
"Watched one movie yesterday then opened the app the next day and I click on my profile and all I get is ""Error: Invalid Input"" and nothing can fix it. I reninstalled, even made a new profile, no luck. This app needs a LOT of work",2023-04-23 16:52:35,1
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP AND USE THIS SERVICE!!! My account got hacked and the hacker changed my email and password. Even tho I still have access to the account on my phone, Paramount+ doesn't allow you to change your details from the app and their customer support and security is atrocious. I have contacted them three times through customer support and each time they say they cannot help me or I get a bot response so now the hacker gets to keep my account with my details on it. Stay away!",2022-06-30 04:50:52,1
"Not user friendly. Most other streaming services, when logging onto the app on a smart TV, give you a code you can enter on your mobile and it registers you. Not with this. You have to muck around with an onscreen keyboard. Furthermore, there's no Profiles so each family member can have their own viewing history even though I found a help file (and YouTube videos saying you can). I thought it might be due to the fact I'm still in the 7 day free trial period but got a response from support saying ""We do not have the Profile feature at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience. Although there is no current timeline we can provide you on this feature addition, we’ll send your message to the appropriate department."" So either they have removed the Profile feature (unlikely) or it's not available to Australians. If the latter, why? Why treat us differently?",2022-02-21 07:12:13,1
I really wanted to keep this because I liked the content but the app is so awful it doesn't have a favourites list for shows you like and when you play something it never picks up in the spot you left off very annoying it also skipped one episode completely.,2021-10-04 10:11:27,1
"Suddenly paramount÷ is now skyshowtime and no longer in my country. But i am a ""valued"" customer. Sure... and my info will be transferred. Even though i can never use it in my country. Now I totally understand why Playstation and Xbox never allowed your app in on their consoles. Sucky app and even worse company. Seems customers are NOT Paramount in your eyes. See what I did there?",2022-09-05 14:01:23,1
Don't bother. You'll pay for a subscription you can rarely use due to constant app crashes and occasional website failure when using PC making it impossible to ever access the content when you want it. Such a shame as the content is good.,2023-10-17 21:08:31,1
"Good selection, but the app needs a genre selection so you don't have to scroll until you see something you like. Also as big as the company is its still not supported on the xbox platform for some reason.",2023-06-22 16:56:49,3
"Drops out more than Netflix, and often restarts something, rather than continuing from where you are up to. Can't do picture in picture, but does have good stuff.",2023-01-10 16:11:50,4
"Better since the last update, but still a little jerky, the ""control of it"" and the worst part of this service is it DRAINS data !!! Worse than Netflix and that's saying something !!! I'm more than disappointed with your app !! 💯💔",2023-07-29 04:59:15,2
"Although I have a current subscription I can rarely watch any program. Whilst I can sign in when selecting a program to watch I more often than not get the this message "" We are experiencing technical difficulties please try again later"". This steaming app is a joke.",2021-12-04 04:24:34,1
"App needs work, this is the only streaming app I have downloaded that doesn't go full screen and keeps the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen and sometimes even the top bar is visable.",2023-07-26 17:37:54,2
"The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star rating, is because I can't stream it on Xbox, or mirror it in any way. That part is limited. Otherwise, for me, this app so far has been running very smoothly. Great experience so far! 🙂👍",2022-03-24 16:30:46,4
Works okay on fire stick occasionally the video stutters till it's no longer watchable. We accepted the subscription but when trying to get it on other devices it doesn't accept login credentials and wants us to subscribe separately.,2020-09-05 23:04:43,2
"I'm giving it 4 stars only because the screen size can't be adjusted in my phone, when playing a movie it's only taking about 70% of my phone screen and unlike Netflix or other apps, it can't be adjusted to fit the entire screen.",2022-08-10 00:11:02,4
"The app often - roughly once an hour, although it does vary - stops playing and requires a restart. BBC iPlayer, Netflix and prime don't do this so it's an app issue not a broadband problem.",2023-08-13 18:48:55,2
"A contract trap? I can't unsubscribe. The log-in takes me to the legal page, to a hyper link, that instructs me to alter subscription through the app store? Impossible. I just want to unsubscribe.

Please advise, or I may have to contact them to lodge a complaint.",2023-08-07 06:23:02,1
Doesn't even work don't waste your time. Every time I open the app it says it's got to close due to technical difficulties and the web page won't let me sign up for account. Go with Netflix or someone who wants to accept new customers.,2023-02-28 22:04:23,1

False advertisement .... I heard they had all of the nickelodeon shows so I was super excited ...downloaded the app only to find out none of the nickelodeon shows are available to canada ....so the app is pretty much garbage ...maybe 2 shows I actually like ....everything else is old or lame and not worth the money ....super disappointed...

I honestly thought it would have more shows and movies to select from is it worth yes if you want to watch certain things but do the trial run first because it might not have what you want to watch for shows or movies it does have some good stuff to watch just not as much it makes it seem to be,2023-02-02 02:45:46,3
"Paramount+ is great, loads of shows and films. All 25 seasons of Southpark. No ads at all. All Star Trek shows and films. So far it's been a brilliant app. I'm really enjoying watching it. Keep it up Paramount+ you're Awesome.🤩😲😁",2023-01-12 08:34:56,5
They just removed like over half their shows with no warning to make way for movies you can see anywhere else. Why remove content you're supposed to own and with no warning! Now there is WAY less content. I was half-way through some shows,2021-07-30 19:51:46,2
"Canadian content different than US content. Video and audio out of sync. I'm sure CBS must have the budget for a proper app and the rights to the missing content north of the border.

I already pay for this through my amazon account and dont like the fact that i would have to pay twice for the same services. It would be better if the app recognised the amazon sign in instead of having to pay separately for the same acces,2022-09-04 18:26:30,1
Outside of the US Paramount has missed the mark. Between shows and services not available but expecting the same price is really sad and frustrating. Overall I would say do not support the service or the app until they step up their game.,2022-01-01 02:49:11,1
"Extremely poor. Got it for cheap with A-league membership. As if having to watch Perth glory isn't bad enough. This app makes the experience worse. Barely works.. have to clear cache, uninstall and reboot phone to get it to respond. Just tried loading the Socceroos live and the thing spat the dummy and wouldn't play or cast it at all.

"Very poor security- chances are you will get your account hacked and your log on email address changed. Then when it happens customer service will give you some BS about confirming your original email address that you used to sign up with and you end up going round in circles and Paramount themselves end up giving up on you as they dont want to know really.

"Why will you not allow video to display full screen, I installed the app on my s22 ultra and the image is almost 1/2 the real estate of the screen... If I hadn't got this service free with sky movies I would uninstall... Certainly wouldn't pay for it with this issue.",2022-07-25 21:31:51,1
"I had started my free trial and tried to watch a movie, it keeps giving me an error message. Tried to watch literally anything else and all I get was error message. Didnt even last an hour into my free trial. App sucks.",2021-09-11 04:25:54,1
"App always shows an error now always has technical difficulties, when it is working you will get halfway threw an episode then it will show a playback error or show error 3005 ut aint an internet issue like google says its the service. when something does get fixed they add 10 more issues",2023-08-22 04:54:10,1
Cant view in full screen on a Samsung phone 👎👎👎. Cancelling the subscription as the App wont allow full screen on mobile. Half my screen is not being used so watching through a small window is not viewable at all. Please fix,2022-07-28 21:50:12,1
"Super app and content is not that bad, nur unfortunally a small range of movies/series. And there's no perfect fullscreen on my phone (G Pixel 5), but on my Chromecast it works fine.",2022-12-21 09:38:48,4
I was weary having seen the negative reviews. I actually like the app but the difficulty I have atm is that the app randomly will no longer load if I'm connected to wifi and will only load if I'm on my mobile network. I have to be on my mobile network to stream any shows. This sucks a lot of data and will likely be the reason I cancel my subscription (sad to say),2021-10-26 10:03:58,3

"The content has a great amount of variety to it, across different brands including Smithsonian and Nickelodeon. The movies on offer are taken from the entire collection of Paramount, including some of Jack Nicholson's older movies, all of Mission Impossible and Transformers. And Star Trek!",2023-04-07 12:15:29,5
This app is so glitchy. It won't even open if you are offline. Its pretty poor compared to all the other streaming apps. Not worth the subscription if they can't even get the app to work.,2023-04-14 21:52:59,1
Similar to other streaming apps. I am enjoying the Halo series and other sxi fi shows such as star trek. One issue I have is the skip intro and start next episode options are usually missing. Hopefully this will be fixed in an update soon.,2022-08-03 17:17:08,4
"Save your time and save your money, this is a terrible offering. There's really nothing to watch on this service. Maybe Halo? But that was so bad that it only last 15 mins. I literally went through their entire catalog and couldn't find anything worthwhile to watch - maybe Top Gun but by that point I just couldn't care",2023-01-18 06:45:43,1
"Hi, I'm trying to sign up with you guys and get the 7 day free trial but there's been a technical issue with my email account and banking. I have deleted the app and tried again but it still gives me a message saying, (error:%1$d) Would like some assistance please.",2021-08-25 08:17:59,1

"I am absolutely disappointed!!!! I have been waiting for over half an hour for Paramount+ International to email a link so that I may reset my password to enable me to watch TV. A family member is currently online, using a tablet, but, I cannot sign into the TV app. And, when I try and link to resetting, I am sent completely stupid pictures, like pick out motorcycles, cars, stairs, traffic lights ... on and on and on ad nauseam. WHY IS RESETTING YOUR PASSWORD SUCH A DAMNED PAIN IN THE NECK?",2023-10-07 19:42:50,1

Honestly I do love watching one of my faves shows on here but... it recently started saying theres something wrong when I try loading the app I go on my profile and it wont load the screen for movies and shows I even tried deleting and reinstalling the app nothing works please fix this issue,2023-04-23 17:36:12,4

Crashes my phone on use. No idea why but my 1 year old phone hates this app. After installing it crashes the phone. App when it works is slow and buggy not good. (I also have it on my Samsung TV thay doesn't work at all),2022-07-03 18:11:56,1

"You have a function to add things to the ""watchlist"" and than no way to view this ""watchlist"" - pure stupidity so be happy it's not 1 star. - - Your reply ""if you have any issues, contact our support team"" seems to be either automatic or copy and paste without checking how your app works in UK - for this laziness dropping to one star. Also: No option to reject all ""legitimate interest"" cookies - put it simply I want no cookies, non , zero, nada, NOTHING - MY DATA IS MY ALONE. I pay so screw you",2023-01-06 00:23:21,1
Wish they has more content. Lots of shows over the years they could add to the digital library. Discovered this after cutting netflix and with more content they could definitely give netflix some serious competition.,2023-03-30 19:00:56,4
"I'm hearing double..? Its like listening to it as it happens, but also hearing 5-10 seconds ahead at the same time. Absolute s#*! Doesn't work right. Uninstalling immediately",2021-12-04 07:08:00,1
"Would give 0 stars if possible. App is horrendous. No way to find specific episodes, episodes DO NOT autoplay despite settings. Can't even manually go to next episode. It's a shame. I love Star Trek and canceled Netflix for this. It's 2022, do better.",2022-06-21 08:34:39,1
"Very difficult to unsubscribe. Remember the device and how you signed up for app or you can't unsubscribe. Apparently i didnt do on app?

With this mess around trying to unsubcibe I will not be back Paramount. Burnt me",2022-05-25 17:29:02,1
Enjoying the different shows. I got paramount+ to watch last King of the Cross then fell in love with the different range of movies and shows that Netflix dosent have and let go of Netflix. It's just been really enjoyable value for money,2023-04-28 23:28:50,5
I see ads all the time about shows being on Paramount+ but not listed on mine. Shows keep disappearing with nothing put in their place. Really annoying and almost not worth the money I pay every month.,2021-09-11 15:36:22,3
"App poorly designed. Will not adjust ratio for your screen, no 4K support. Lack of shows and movies and no app for the playstation. Sport streaming also plagued with issues Save your money better streamings services out there!",2021-11-20 11:26:22,1
Doesn't even support 4K on google TV yet their website says it's does. How can you launch an app in 2022 so far behind what the competition has offered for years. Simply not good enough. O can't buy 4k movies through google and can't watch them on your app.,2022-06-02 11:31:16,1
This app is terrible on my smart TV. It is often glitchy to the point where it won't play what is select. It also doesn't have a huge range of things to watch. Wouldn't recommend,2022-07-11 11:31:11,1
Paramount+ was good to start with but after free trial there's been nothing but issues with it crashing or stopping unexpectedly im guessing it a bug issue that no one has bothered to fix. Will be uninstalling,2021-12-09 06:40:42,1
Love the fact it has the entire catalogue of paw patrol which up until now has been spread across several streaming services in UK. The annoying thing is as my daughter's profile is set to young kids when an episode of paw patrol finishes and the next episode is meant to autoplay but we get an error message stating the content is not available due to age restrictions so have to manually start the next episode. Also some of the episodes has broken audio and has dialogue only with no music or SFX.,2022-06-30 14:08:49,2
"Great app, cheap monthly, awesome shows, and let's me pay using Google credit. Only issue is when I cast to my chrome cast the episode always restarts to the beginning, gets annoying. Would love to see a fix :)",2020-05-11 01:30:50,3
"Nothing but lag. Took my partner 1 hr to watch the final 4 mins of her movie. I dared to update the app and now it shuts utself down after a few seconds. Love the content but there is litterally no way to access it. Not worth the money at this point, as most of the other reviews have said.",2021-12-07 15:30:19,1
Was good. App on tablet stopped working and can't get it to work again. Paid for the year and now useless. Update: put a ticked in and still not working. I have updated the app and its a no go. Figured out I can watch from website but expeience is not the same. ☹,2023-04-23 10:51:12,1
Good app but I won't use it because I can't change the streaming quality options on my android device or my iPad. Would love to know of there is a way to do this. My iPad doesn't even have a settings button while streaming,2023-02-09 09:33:56,3
"This is the worst ever. When I first subscribed, I was watching a few things, and then one day, they were gone. I told customers service what happened, and they want to know what show, what episode. I told the the shows that were missing from their programming, and they still can't answer me to why its gone even that new show true lies is a Paramount plus show and I can't even get that. What kind of service is this? Very poor service. I can see why it got 2.5 stars.",2023-04-21 22:00:53,1

"Exceeding poor selection, literally only got it to see the South Park special and after a few moments of seeing what else might be there I am looking at how to cancel even before the 7 day trial is over. Total worth of this service is between 2-4hrs depending on how you feel about Tom Cruise I suppose. But all of those films are available elsewhere. 0/5",2021-12-21 23:40:33,1
Rubbish. Recieved no emails. No customer service! I can't sign in or change password. Terrible service. Say always teyon to improve but does not as any prblems are still there and not rectified. Using google store and can'y sign in on other devies or reset password. App only avialiable on certain devices. Playstation doesn't have it. Want refund as missold product but have no customer support which is illegal in UK!,2023-08-21 11:35:28,1
"Tried it out, wasn't my cup of tea, subscription to anything is fine because you can unsubscribe with no problems. For this one though, there is no chance, you try on the app, it says try the website, try the website, it says try the app store, try the app store and it doesn't even give the option, so here I am, paying for something I don't want.",2022-12-07 08:56:27,1

Works well enough. Some sound issues casting through Chromecast. Biggest issue is that the shows are not the same with the Canadian version. Variety is extremely limited because of Bell Media group,2018-10-29 20:14:42,2

Paramount plus is becoming a great app. I first signed on a few years ago when it was CBS. It's grown and added new shows and content. For example they've added things like Top Gun and all the Star Trek series and movies. They can give Netflix and Disney serious competition now. I really like the direction they're going. Keep it up Paramount.,2023-02-12 17:32:43,5

"I'm not sure why ratings are so low, I've been binge watching Survivor on my Chromecast all day and haven't had one issue, so I'm loving it so far! I can't see this being something I keep for long, because there's not much of a selection, but it functions well.",2019-12-15 04:03:52,5
I uploaded and signed on for two shows. Star Trek Picard and Star Trwk Discovery. Not only that the shows were not available. Paramount has something close to 30 shows for pplnwanting to subscribe. I was led astray because I wanted to see shows they advertised on website. But do not have them on their site,2021-09-22 03:47:25,1
Constantly buffering and almost impossible to watch! Full service and strong wifi connection does not fix it. Good variety of shows and movies but hard to watch when constantly buffering,2022-01-03 10:30:26,2
Works well but could do with a resume where left for Chromecast. Also needs a skip intro. Other than those improvements I've had no issues what so ever.,2022-07-22 22:50:34,5
All I can say is I'm glad this app had a free trial. I only found a few limited programs of interest. I cancelled within 48hrs of subscribing. There are better subscription services than this one.,2022-02-20 03:31:05,1
Casting shows only works for a small amount of shows for some reason??? I could bypass that issue if this app was available on my nvidia shield but for some reason it is not .. unusable until this is fixed. Instantly unsubscribed,2019-09-18 19:28:57,1

the website NEVER works so you are forced to watch on your phone which constantly pauses and freezes while casting to the TV. The app is just horrible and skips episodes or randomly shuts off pkus the customer service is a joke.,2019-01-16 22:32:06,1
"Does share to TV so Paramount looks like they are absolutely commited to not working on a big screen at all. No tv app, no Xbox app, and the phone app won't screen share. It's not that hard guys.",2022-03-27 01:50:57,1
"Could someone tell me if I should be getting surround sound. I don't get it on my TV or Fire TV, just stereo. I watch on my TV and find the lack of surround sound very disappointing. The others manage it.",2022-08-19 10:22:01,3

On phone good for casting but the worst app iv ever used on LG TV I mean makes me want to un subscribe drom whole thing. Shocking,2023-12-28 17:44:36,1
Like the programs but can't upgrade plan or do anything with account unless you do it on original device signed up on,2024-01-07 10:36:48,1

Hi i really like this app but can there be for example more subscriptions like how much for a lifetime and weekly,2024-02-20 15:02:19,3
Would give 5 stars if it would pause and ask if your still watching after a few hours or so as I tend to fall asleep watching it,2024-01-29 11:35:18,4
It sucks!....please tell me again for the 7th time how I unsubscribe...which is nowhere to be found where you say it is!! Every show I try to watch is unavailable in my county OR I try to watch something from the very beginning. Survivor for example will not allow me to watch a season until up in the 30 seasons. What's with that??? What a tremdous clusterf***. And of course now I can't unsubscribe. You should be charged for providing such horrible service and charging what you do. Shame on you!,2023-12-10 09:47:01,1

I watched season 1-5 on amazon and moved to paramount for season 6 you need to fix this, i cancelled my trial as you ruined the show for me.",2022-09-03 14:59:26,1

"No next episode button, doesn't autoplay, no option to list episodes so I don't have to manually scroll through an episode just to get to the next episode - seriously does anyone screen these apps before releasing them?

If in every 3/4 plays it crashes with glitchy playback when it does work, gone are the days of care- free watching- you'll be so mad, you'll forget you sat down to relax and escape!!

If I could give zero I would. The app is rubbish it continually freezers. If you want to watch the A League good luck. Hopefully if enough people complain they will fix it. After almost a year the app is still rubbish. How about instead of asking people to contact your service team how about fixing it,2022-09-22 10:31:04,1

Trial seems to be so limited you have access to maybe 50 shows. None in genres I enjoy really. So cancelled subscription and uninstalled within half an hour of signing up and installing app. Was looking forward to watching things like ST: Discovery and other sci Fi but don't have adequate chance to watch anything good to see if I'd like to pay for subscription. Avoid. Go to Prime or Disney.,2021-01-28 19:06:24,1

Buffers way too much. No other streaming service does this except Paramount. And now episodes have disappeared. Was watching NCIS LA and on season 8 episode 23. Season finale was episode 24. Was late so I decided to watch it the next day but the next day that episode was gone. So are episode 1 and 2 of that season. Why would these episodes suddenly disappear and the rest remain. So had to move onto season 9 without seeing the finale from season 8. Contacted them but heard nothing since.,2022-07-30 16:08:13,1

Only got paramount for A-League. Poor quality to say the least. Can't rewind or pause live games. Quality is glitchy. No TV app yet either? Wouldve thought launching an new service they would have covered all bases. Very disappointed so far.,2021-11-27 07:26:58,1

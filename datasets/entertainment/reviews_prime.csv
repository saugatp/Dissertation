"Everything was working fine, with no problems or issues with the app. But after its recent update, movies and shows are still loading and playing, however its only the audio itself. Whatever is playing will show up blank. I tried logging out and logging back in, but that didn't work. So I uninstalled the app went and logged back in, hoping it would work, and that didn't work either. Would have given it 5 stars, but due to this inconvenience, I'm considering unsubscribing to Amazon Prime Video.",2024-04-20 03:59:33,3
"Overall great selection and a smooth running app. My only problem is lately when I come back to a show it has put me episodes behind where I was watching. Also if there is an ad when I'm scrolling ahead the media will continue playing but won't let me do anything saying ""you cannot skip during ads"" and that doesn't go away until I close the app, go back to the show, and find my episode all over again. This has made me give up on watching many times. Please fix this glitch",2024-04-16 19:50:07,3
"This app is unusable. I used to love prime video, but now I can't even watch anything. Everything buffers, freezes, and glitches. The audio will glitch and repeat while the screen freezes. No amount re-downloading or re-starting helps. I'm done. Only had prime so I could watch stuff, now I cant even do that. First the ads, and now it's completely unwatchable. I am beyond disappointed. Time to go back to HBO I guess.",2024-04-23 19:13:49,1
"Always a lagging, buffering or some kind issue with this streaming service. All others, Netflix, Hulu, etc will load right up. Terrible on a firestick device when all others work well. Frustrating. Also, the most user NON-friendly interface, especially when you order more channels through Prime. It's the pits all the way around. I hate when a good series comes up on Amazon Prime! I never end up having the patience to get through the 1st few episodes before I go onto Netflix or Hulu...",2024-04-08 16:18:41,1
"The app has degraded during last few years. There used to be a ""Free to me"" option to filter through all the ""add on"" channels but now it is gone. The screen is dominated by pay-to-view content and subscriptions that I do not have and top purchases. Really gives you the feeling that the main idea is to get to you spend money rather than supply a proper experience with the content that I've already subscribed to. It is really so bland in this case that I find it not appealing.",2024-04-07 15:54:45,2
"Not user friendly. Try to rewind and it minimizes my video to show me cast/info I don't care about and the zoom button is hidden. Try to skip intros and it registers as you hitting the timer and takes you all the way to the end. No ""Skip to end/next"" button, you gotta fast forward it 10 seconds at a time, or drag the timer, or back all the way out to get to the next episode if you want to skip one. Ads?? Seriously how do I pay over $100 a year for this and my free youtube has a better interface.",2024-04-18 14:28:15,1
"Recent addition of pay-to-skip-adverts is obnoxious, considering I am already paying to be a Prime member, and that Amazon Prime video content seems to be declining in quality, compared to Netflix, Max and other content providers. Excellent playback at 1080p is frequently interrupted at random intervals by frame skipping, playback freeze, and hashed/static-filled frames.",2024-04-24 11:23:57,2
"In general, it's a convenient app to have, especially during those times when you don't have access to good cable while traveling. If I were to give it a negative review, it would be how aggravating it is to have a subscription in other apps/ services that Amazon prime has access to, but you can't connect your subscription to theirs. Basically, you'll have to pay a double subscription to get the same thing from Amazon that you're paying elsewhere. Fix ASAP please....",2024-04-17 04:27:39,4
"Haven't had any major issues with the app on my device. However when I'm on the move (usually due to the nature of my job being in an ambulance) the videos do tend to buffer and take longer to load. Also the video player sometimes has a tendency to kick me from what I'm watching if my finger brushes the top of the screen in the wrong way accidentally. Otherwise, everything else has been great. Prime Video has definitely helped me get through some reeeaaally long shifts in the past",2024-04-16 10:15:18,4
"It's good. You can't find this amount of movies anywhere. The only thing is, lately the app has not been working properly. I'll click on it and I'll just get a black screen. I have to click out and then quickly click back in again for it to work. I tried deleting and then reinstalling the app, but it's doing the same thing. Update: as you are all aware, they are making us pay EXTRA to be commercial free! Greed strikes again. Ugh. Removing 2 stars.",2024-04-09 22:55:52,2
"I like that I can take my Amazon videos with me. I don't like the video player it's self. It is just too hard to navigate with in a video. You can't easily and precisely FF or RW to a specific point at all. And, just moving ahead or back the pre-determined 10 seconds takes about as long as it took for the entire video to load in the first place. Netflix and YouTube apps do a MUCH better job at in-video navigation.",2024-04-07 16:50:45,3
"I'm not sure what happened to this app, but it has become unwatchable. I have the latest Samsung Galaxy 24 Ultra, and yet shows take way too long to buffer, and every 10 seconds, the show stutters. This started a few months ago and after looking it up online it seems only mobiles are affected by this. Please fix your app, your company is too big for this shoddy work.",2024-04-21 11:43:58,1
"Very annoyed as of last few weeks. Everyday the app on TV has an internet issue or something else and will not load. When I look up the issue it says I need to restart my internet router. Which is dumb because it's not my internet that is the issue, it is the Amazon prime video app. All other TV apps work fine, so it's not my internet. Fix the app issues please.",2024-04-21 19:44:27,1
"I don't generally leave overwhelmingly negative reviews, but whoof. Let me break down the usual experience. Start show, watch 30-60 seconds of ads. After 10-15 minutes the app crashes. Reboot app 3-4 times while it keeps telling you its ""currently unavailable"". When you do finally get back in, you have to watch those ads again to start your show back up. Then it usually loses your spot when it crashes so you've gotta fast forward and in doing so, incur another 30+ second ad. And this isn't new.",2024-04-05 18:25:22,1
"The video plays well and rarely is there any lag. The problem for me is the availability of shows. I like to rewatch shows I haven't seen in years. I started one yesterday and got through season 1 today. I go to continue to the next season and it, as well as, the next 10 seasons are currently unavailable. It is a Discovery+ show that I pay extra to get, and yet there are 9 seasons that I cannot watch.",2024-04-12 22:08:57,3
"Why am I paying for something that barely functions? The content I purchase, including subscriptions such as Paramount+, sporadically won't allow me to access them without repurchasing. Customer service might as well be nonexistent. Not to mention, it's overpriced, considering I still have to watch ads unless I shell out more money to remove them. This applies to Prime Video, Amazon Music, and even Audible. We've begun collecting physical copies of media and will be discontinuing Amazon entirely",2024-04-05 05:25:42,1
"Would rate higher if the app worked on Chrome cast. Typically, it won't load Prime Video at all. If it does, the video you choose won't play. Loads for like 5 mins then says something went wrong, retry, but doesn't load no matter how many times you do. Internet isn't the issue, we have max speed wifi, and all other apps work just fine, no buffering. Very disappointing because Prime used to be our favorite streaming app.",2024-04-05 17:17:09,3
"If I watch several successive episodes of a 45 minute each series and then try to switch to something else, it gives me a security error, basically saying ""failure to authenticate."" That's a hassle when I'm using it as background noise and, one might think, UNNECESSARY, when viewing previousely downloaded content THAT I OWN!",2024-04-21 03:27:21,2
"The whole reason I justified paying for Prime was because it included Prime Video, in addition to reliable shipping. However, I am not a fan of Amazon adding ads to the video service and telling me I can pay more to remove them. If they don't walk back on this by the time of my next billing period, I will be canceling my prime subscription.",2024-04-18 19:36:37,1
"Used to be good, but then they got greedy with the ads or extra charge for ad-free. I've cancelled my prime membership because of this, and because of their attacks on the NLRB. Deciding to be evil and annoying at the same wasn't a great idea. Unskippable ads that are poorly targeted. I hate every company I've seen and hate them more for being irritating.",2024-04-20 15:22:20,1
I love the movie selection! But I cannot stand that it auto plays even when the setting is turned off! It also does a terrible job keeping your place and you have to go through about 8 commercials to find where you left off because the app won't do it for you!,2024-04-23 18:37:42,2
"Prime needs to figure out how to incorporate ads properly. In the middle of an intense scene or even mid sentence is not the time. I forget what happened by the time the ads are done. I watch free streaming apps with ads with no issues. Amazon is large enough to have figured this out before adding them. Amazon really has gone downhill, but they keep raising their prices without the ability to choose what you want to include in your membership. It's finally time to cancel. Let us choose our plan.",2024-04-19 18:10:35,1
"I've tried 3 times to use this app for a particular show, Marry My Husband. While I haven't used it for anything else and didn't intend to except for that one show, it was pointless because it is a Korean drama with subtitles, and the only subtitle language that would download on the app was Bahasa Melayu, which took up over half of the screen. The desktop version is superior, but this was very inconvenient. I don't intend to use this app again for foreign shows, if I ever intend to use it again",2024-04-22 16:22:17,1
"It's not just that the app is more frustrating to use than others, or that lately it has seemed to only get more laggy, but the introduction of ""ads unless you pay up"" + the sheer volume of ads has ruined it. At least others offer decent discounts for their ad tiers, while Amazon keeps moving content to Freevee to make sure even ad-free subscribers are inundated. No one wants or uses the ever-growing list of prime ""services"" they keep increasing prices for. We need affordable options, not this.",2024-04-17 20:59:03,1
"Amazon doesn't care about their app. Works only ok on tablet, terrible on smart tv, can't connect a lot of the time over broadband WiFi when no other app has issues. Maybe if they actually paid programmers in the USA to perfect it, it would work better but it absolutely doesn't and there is no USA support other than uninstall reinstall which is a joke. ridiculous Amazon, if you have an app support it. If you won't support it, remove it. Considering cancelling Prime, just not worth it anymore.",2024-04-07 00:40:41,2
"Amazon is very convenient, but this app is not as good as it was. I am already paying for Prime, so the main content should be what I already pay for, not all the other pay channels. There used to be a toggle ""free to me"", they need to bring that back. I just added Max for the bicycle racing coverage and noticed replays of everything except cycling are available. It may be an add-on to Prime, but it is a poorly handled one.",2024-04-18 14:05:40,3
"Instead of charging more to eliminate ads, there should be a lower cost tier that includes ads. Content for paying customers should be the focus of highlights, not rentals and subscriptions for other services. If Prime insists on ads, play them before and after content. Content should not be interrupted with ads. Tubi, Crackle, Freevee, etc. do this already with no fee.",2024-04-19 15:52:47,3
"The ads are ridiculous. They are the same annoying ones, over and over, and there are far too many. If you missed something and need to hit back button during a movie, you have to watch ads again sometimes double as many , even though you already got through the miserable monotony of them just moments ago. Thanks prime, like we don't spend enough on you already. Amazon music went down the drain now this. I don't understand how a company can jack your prices every year plus make you watch adds.",2024-04-01 16:33:10,1
"Used to love it. Now they have made it impossible. There are so many different platforms to pay extra for and the ad free is not really ad free at all. On top of that, several times now I have FINALLY found a series to watch that require additional purchases, but halfway through said series I open the app, looking forward to watching and suddenly I have to pay per episode to watch. Or subscribe to some entirety different streaming service. It's gotten ridiculous.",2024-04-02 04:01:30,1
"Long buffer times. And it constantly loses track of where I leave off with shows. And it will freeze if I pause, then press play. The only reason I'm giving three stars instead of 2 is because I like the shows. As far as the apps performance, it's poor in my opinion",2024-04-24 22:07:47,3
"Loved it when I started to use it, but now the ads are outrageous. I would never use freevee because that is why I stopped watching regular TV channels. So I think I am gonna drop some channels and have already gone back to showtime HBO on direct TV. Now, I lose control of what to watch as for choices, but most of the time, they are playing at least one movie I want to watch. Last about charging more once you are already paying for the extra channels. Hulu and Netflix are in the same bag gonna.",2024-04-05 11:49:34,2
"love it. I switched from Netflix and couldn't be happier. Great service. Thus was f4om 2019. Now, what little content there is, is over run with woke. They have even more ads and most selections I'm interested in are on tubing or Freeview which hit you with FIVE ads at a time. I'm looking for an alternative. It's like everything else. it's a good idea, it picks up momentum, greed kicks in and they want an astronomical profit so raise prices and cut cost on content.",2024-03-24 22:33:26,1
"The app was perfect. I stress that word WAS. I've been with prime for several years now and when I first joined the only problem was that the ""good"" movies used to be distributed out over time . Like maybe once or twice a month. Then there would be a lag. That problem was eventually fixed and prime was pretty good for a while. Then they started raising the overall fees. I adapted. Now they've added commercials. On top of that , series that I used to watch for free are now available at a charge.",2024-03-29 11:22:33,3
"Prime Video excels in its diverse content selection. However, its app is a letdown. It repeatedly redirects to random episodes after finishing one, and resuming becomes a chore due to frequent, unnecessary ads. This severely hampers the viewing experience, making an otherwise excellent service frustrating. An upgrade in user interface is crucial",2024-03-25 05:57:31,1
I'm usually fine with ads but this app shows the same ads over and over to the point I can't word for word repeat it. I wish there was a variety at least. It sucks and I'm about to leave the app just because of it. There are also only so many movies you can watch till you have to pay for another subscription within the app you already pay for. It's ridiculous,2024-04-04 20:22:03,1
"Similar to the comment Jennifer wrote, the App recently began freezing up. It has having a hard time transitioning between the Xray view, picture-in-picture view, and the full screen view. I usually have to lock my screen, unlock it, then close the app completely and reopen it for it to work again. The app needs a patch, I believe it started after the addition of the x-ray view, which was an excellent add.",2024-03-10 08:28:47,3
"Used to be a 5 star streaming service, to me. Now, it's a 0 star. Of course you have to go and add ads to a streaming service that was once free for Prime members (which you're raising the cost of, AGAIN), you expect us to ALSO pay for Prime Video to remove ads. For a completely broken system. No way. Every time an episode is almost over, it goes to the next episode, BEFORE it even reaches the end credits. If it's an important episode, I have to go back just to finish it. Incredibly frustrating.",2024-02-14 04:19:36,1
"Fix your freaking app! If I try to clear away the menu when I Zoom my screen to full size, it automatically jumps the video forward to where I touched the screen with my finger because it instantly becomes the timeline bar. Why would it not be a slider? Why would touching anywhere on the slider instantly jump the video to that point? I can't be the only person to have dealt with this issue. It has been going on for an extraordinarily long time. I'm just finally fed up with it enough. And ads.",2024-02-26 13:00:19,2
"Overall the app works well, the latest update defaults to x-ray mode every time so the video is small at the top of the screen and you have to tell it to swap to landscape every time. The other annoying thing is that the sort for purchases defaults to most recent every time. Usually I'm looking for a specific movie and I don't need to look through a random arrangement of all my movies when an arrangement is more useful. There should be an option to set the default for the sort function.",2024-02-15 22:00:38,2
Prime used to be alright. The addition of commercials is unacceptable. Then trying to upcharge users to remove them. As if Amazon isn't making enough money. Their profits rose in 2023 by around 13%. The current $9.99 is more than enough to stream without ads. Edit: Quickly becoming the worst streaming service of all. The app has turned into complete trash. Doesn't keep place in shows anymore. If it's left paused for too long it completely forgets what you were watching.,2024-02-16 05:42:36,1
"Ever since the ads were added, there are huge problems with audio not syncing with video and video going completely absent while sound remains .. the only good part of this situation is that the ads are blanked as well. The app gets you there, but the service is spotty at best. And for those who think this is some sort of bandwidth issue, I've had Prime for a long time with ZERO problems .. the issues started exactly when the ads did.",2024-02-12 09:54:21,2
Searching and UI are subpar. There's a lot of optimizations needed for this app to go toe to toe with its competitors. When I search with included with prime i should not be able to see rent/buy movies at all until i change my search. One button is all it should take. When backing out of a movie it sends me to the top of the main page. VERY annoying. Subtitle quality is bad. Now you charge to get rid of ads. What a joke. Terrible service. Don't recommend this over the other streaming subs.,2024-02-12 05:59:51,1
"As much as I love a lot of those shows on the site, it's baffling to me that even owning a subscription, you still have to purchase/rent some shows. The shows on the site have really good options for different languages and subtitle settings as well. I still can't get over the double pay way though. I'll still continue with my subscription as I love some of the shows, but wowzee that's a shocker.",2024-02-09 22:15:38,3
Easy to search for videos and movies. Addition of adds is a little annoying but thankfully they are not very long and don't happen too often. Can easily access all features on tablet. On mobile it doesn't show my purchased items for some reason. Doesn't really ever freeze or crash. Occasionally lags and loads slowly. Like the thumbs up feature. Appreciate the presence of trailers instead of just reading the synopsis. Also really like the detailed cast and trivia information.,2024-03-04 02:01:03,4
"Stopped my paid subscription. It was doing ok. Until the last 6 months. It has been malfunctioning. Wont respond. starts playing song or podcast, and after 60 seconds stops , or stops multiple times during play back and / or stops and won't restart song. I've tried all suggestions on help and even complained multiple times to amazon. nothing has been corrected. Don't recommend it.",2024-02-11 09:43:52,1
"Amazon prime be smoking the crack. I don't know of they are feuding with some of the platforms they support or if the ones that don't pay their dues end up with malfunctioning, but prime can't keep track of where you leave off in what you're watching. Another example is that I kept getting a ""watch next"" prompt come up which wouldn't go away, I tried closing it but it jumped right to it. It can't keep track of ""recently watched"" correctly or does so randomly.",2024-03-05 11:29:28,2
"The ads are overwhelming. They are the same annoying ones, over and over, and there are far too many. If you missed something and need to hit back button during a movie, you likely will have to watch ads again, even though you already got through the miserable monotony of them just moments ago. Thanks prime, like we don't spend enough on you already.",2024-03-26 22:07:51,1
"Since adding Ads the experience has gone downhill. I refuse to watch a movie that has ads sprinkled in throughout. I hated that experience with cable, which is a big reason streaming services were appealing. Stopping a movie to play Ads completely kills the immersive movie experience. Juat play some ads before the movie starts and be done! I will NOT be paying a premium fee to remove them! I will just not use your service anymore. There are plenty of other options.",2024-02-12 15:03:54,1
Very good experience with it most of the time. Easy to navigate. Primary issue is the last few weeks it completely freezes my phone (android 2 years old) when the phone rotates and the video tries to adjust and freezes everything but the movie now playing partially visible on screen. I have to forcibly restart my phone to gain control again. I looked to see if the app had an update and it does not.,2024-03-07 13:51:49,4
The screen goes black during the primary ads or when opening to full screen. Nearly EVERY time. Audio works but no video. I'll have to back out and reopen trying to get a picture to show; going through all the ads again EVERY time. Taking 5-10 minutes just to start a show or continue a show/ movie after the ads. Incredibly frustrating. Update: Every. Time.,2024-03-20 05:17:20,1
"Let me start by saying amazon is amazing. This app though, I couldn't tell you. I can watch Netflix, YouTube and any other video. This app doesn't work! Movies and TV shows both neither one work. I can't watch anything. Thank God for Netflix. EDIT: It's been over a month. Videos will play the sound but no picture. Awesome response amazon",2024-03-07 03:17:06,1
"I used to use this as my go-to, but after the addition of all of these ads, it's practically unbearable. Why do i pay extra to watch discovery if there's going to be a 30-second to 3-minute advertising break every 8 minutes??? And no, amazon, im not giving you another few dollars a month to get rid of them all because you want to be greedy. Im canceling my subscription.",2024-03-12 06:34:30,1
"The app works the same as other streaming apps. You can search, save to list, & watch movies and television shows. UPDATE: you can now make purchases in app again (except for subscriptions) BUT when they updated the service to include ads, it somehow messed up the app so that if you're watching picture-in-picture with the video smaller on the screen while using another app on your phone - it won't pause anymore. You have to be watching full screen. Every new update breaks something. It's dumb.",2024-02-18 02:27:46,3
"Regularly experience video play back errors on multiple devices over multiple different data connection paths. Data connections have plenty of available bandwidth. I would never pay extra for anything on prime video with this kind of subpar performance especially considering there are several other options. Tired of getting the generic ""Something went wrong. Please try again later."" and ""Internet connectivity issue"" error messages. So glad Hulu and Netflix don't have these issues!!!",2024-02-23 02:49:15,1
"Too many adds on some (not all ) TV free TV shows The 15 second interruptions are annoying , especially when they interrupt a film in midsentence, and don't return to the same spot in the film. Film with LIMITED ads are reasonable. The monthly has not changed for my PRIME membership. The selection of films is sometimes limited compared to some other free services though One other thing I do like is that only PRIME yells me the number of and the length of the ads coming up.",2024-02-09 04:18:20,3
"Inaccessible to visually impaired. I would've giiven 5, if it weren't for an update or 2 ago it took away the labels for TalkBack. Talkback gets some text, but most is garbage. & if the movie titles are cursive, forget it. & what is this adding an extra button to be able to go into full screen? You have to hit it, & if you're using TalkBack, audio description, & the movie's playing, you hear all of it at the same time. You want me to buy movies, then you stop me from finding movies?

"What a joke. The app won't even open on Android 13 anymore 🤷‍♂️ Before that, issues loading the app and buffering problems.

The only saving grace of this platform is their hit shows ""Upload"" and ""The Expanse.""",2024-04-16 08:08:18,2
"The app gets a second star solely because X-ray (info about actors & such) is a nice feature. It gets a bit of a ding because selection is mediocre AND, despite the extreme cost of Prime membership, most videos add annoying ads. But the primary reason that even a 2-star rating might be a bit generous is that it's rare for the app to successfully play a downloaded video. Many videos won't even start & will show an error message, and some videos will stop playing in the middle of the playback.",2024-03-21 18:41:14,2
I held steady at a 4 star because they have been adding better shows. Then the addition of ads really made this sour because of how poorly it's implemented. If I fall asleep to an episode need to rewind I will get spammed with 6 min straight of ads trying to find where I was. Ad when it starts ad because you fast forward they even give me ads right after watching them when I rewind back over where the ad was to see the scene uninterrupted.,2024-04-12 21:08:19,1
I don't care for Prime Video. It's a total rip off. You already paying for Amazon. Paying extra for Amazon Prime. Paying $10.00 for subscriptions. Then they are charging. To watch up to date series. That should come with the subscription. Almost $30.00 they want. For each new series. You might as well stream somewhere else. You'll come out much cheaper. The way amazon prime video is set up. You might as well. Pay Verizon or Comcast. For a cable bill. Cause this app is ripping people off.,2024-04-14 15:56:57,1
"Rated on app design, not content. 1. It is a pain to rewind & fast forward compared to every other video platform. It is so clunky, either going too slow or too fast and not stopping where you tried to stop it. 2. I should be able to access the sidebar from wherever I am within the platform. Instead, I am often forced to go back, back, back to get back to it. 3. The add-on channels need to be added to the sidebar. I don't want to have to go hunting for them. Prime Video is below Amazon Quality.",2024-04-07 18:00:54,2
"They added ads after I purchased, shameful. The app works fine, you can watch videos and commercials as long as you have some sort of internet. It's not the app. That's terrible, it's the service. They want another $3 a month to take the commercials away from a service that was sold to me without commercials. I have canceled Amazon prime renewals and decided not to watch their videos anymore.",2024-02-16 16:14:14,2
"Unhappy with both the app and the service. Midroll ads are obnoxious for what was onc a premium service. If you must rewind past an ad wall, you will end up watching them on all 3 passes. The volume of the ads is also louder than the actual show/movie by enough to be annoying in the best case. Understandable if the service is purpose built for revenue generation. In many cases, if I have to close the window in the middle of an episode, I'll come back to it starting me several episodes behind.",2024-02-26 22:16:44,1
"I really like the Amazon Prime video app the only issues I've had with it is, whenever I open it and go to a series I haven't finished watching, it takes me to a previous already finished episode of that series instead of playing the next one automatically or letting me pick an episode, it will try to cut off and play the next video before the current one is finished playing all the way through.

It doesn't always work. I usually get a text message popping up in the middle of watching a show that says that this video is currently unavailable. It also says to click on link to customer service but it only takes me to Amazon website not the place where you supposedly fix this problem. I also don't care for the fact that you take off a show I was watching before I finished without giving a warning that show is about to expire. Other than that it's a good app,2024-04-16 07:34:59,3
"I like that it's included with Prime membership and I like the show and movie selections. However, adding commercials was Bad Business. I would have given 5 stars if not for that, now I think 3 is generous. Instead of offering deals to new customers only... Amazon should try offering their loyal, long-standing customers a better deal; or at the very least, get rid of the commercials for them.",2024-02-21 17:57:36,3

Lately third-party services with new content have been added, but practically all of them come with their respective aditional paid subscription. From 2024 the Prime subscription includes adversing and an additional fee is required of 2 Euro/month to remove it. At this point it would be more sense a 100 EUR/y subscription with real good contents and without soccer. App is fine.",2024-04-07 10:02:02,2
"The number one streaming service? Yeah for charging you for everything sure, they're number one in cost. There were maybe 3 shows total I watched that were Amazon originals and the rest you had to pay for so why not just buy DVDs? Seems like the better option considering digital content can be changed or removed at a whim. (Even if you paid for it, read the agreements). Plus they charge extra for ad free viewing on top of that. If you want a leech, this is the right streaming service for you.",2024-02-12 12:54:01,1

In order to fix it,you have to back out and reopen the video, thus forcing you to watch the ads again. The fact that they haven't fixed this leads me to conclude it's intentional. Not only are you forced to watch ads for a paid service, you have to watch twice as many just to fix the black screen. That's a sorry way to treat subscribers. Greed greed greed.",2024-03-14 00:26:06,1
"You'd think price increases would pay for improvements but with Amazon, it's the opposite. Prices keep going up while functionality & benefits keep going down. I am now paying 150% of my original Prime membership fees & have nothing new to show for it except things to complain about. It's glitchier, has more ads, has less quality programming, and other aspects of Prime membership have been hurt, too. The main screen is an ad for the add-ons by constantly directing you to premium content.",2024-03-31 21:59:17,1
"The lay out does not make it easy to find new movies and shows that are free with Prime. Also, I do not like that I'm having to pay more if I want to watch ad free.

My choices are getting more restricted all the time. I order hard goods infrequently, so Prime free shipping isn't a substantial benefit. I do read a lot of Kindle unlimited, but there are other streamers. If this trend continues, I will be deciding whether Prime continues in my home.",2024-04-02 18:58:56,3
"They have a decent range of movies/shows, but too many are purchase-based in proportion. Their app doesn't always retain where you left off and restarts you at a prior episode -- sometimes several episodes -- from where you left off. The now-added commercials are slightly annoying but are relatively short and not *too* frequent, if again still annoying given the subscription rates. If my partner didn't subscribe us then honestly I'd drop Prime at this point. It's not horrible, but not great.",2024-03-12 16:46:31,2
"The whole point of paying for a subscription for Amazon Prime was for 2 reasons: 1. Free next day delivery on purchases (avg. about 40% of items I purchased qualify) And, 2. Videos/Movies without ads. (Now they're running ads, but for EVEN MORE MONEY PER MONTH you can watch ad free.) Even WITH a paid Amazon Prime subscription, most of the movies I want to watch are listed as Rent or Buy. What is the point of the bloodsucking leach of a subscription if you have to keep on paying more and more?",2024-02-28 13:58:55,3
"Functionality is fine but honestly just miss when this was a benefit of being a prime member instead of a multi host streaming platform.

"Could use a little better organization when it comes to searching and seasons, but all in all, one of the top entertainment apps I've subscribed to. General selection is very good, and the apps functionality far surpasses other apps. Hated the dysfunction of the Disney app so much I refused to even use another's account, so i think that says something. Playback quality has always been on track.

Think again you have to wait for the adds you just watched before it froze up again and you gotta watch some more after you skip to the part you were at. Oh but don't worry your video might not load and it might freeze up but the ads are just fine they load 100% and never freeze. Create problems, sell solution",2024-03-21 16:13:17,1
"Good selection but it should be harder for my kids to order shows and movies so I don't get so many added charges. Ads are way too long. Sometimes I'll just switch to max or something else just to avoid them. Just less ads all together would be wise. The app that gets the ads down will be the one I stick with. But come on prime, every time I try to watch something on a break or while I'm waiting for something I get real annoyed.",2024-03-25 03:21:36,2
"Used to really enjoy Prime Video but since they've added ads even though I pay for Prime Membership, which isn't cheap, it really sucks now. The ads seem to get longer the longer I watch episodes. On top of this, they now censor words even if it's not a kid account and there's no way to disable that, it's extremely annoying. If there is, it's not intuitive. I'm not paying an extra $3 a month to not have ads on a service I already pay over $100 on and to not be able to disable censorship. BOOOO!",2024-02-15 19:58:39,2
"Has gotten worse. The app was really good, and then they made everyone pay for no commercials (which I am not). The window screen has NOT been updated for the newest Android phones, so it will get stuck when trying to go back to large screen. I have to restart my phone when this happens. I'll be on full 5G, and the video will stop and say I have no internet connection?!? Amazon took a good thing and made it worse on purpose, but why?",2024-02-27 17:54:20,2
"Paying to disable ads is ridiculous. Only other complaint is that we can't cast to our Google Hubs. Anyways, this service used to be good, until we started having to pay for less than what was originally included for free. These annoyances become much more annoying when you're paying too much. I think you're better off subscribing to the individual streaming services (Max, Paramount or whatever), since you almost have to anyways as Prime's exclusives (that appeal to me) are few and far between.",2024-03-14 00:55:50,2

Some of the other stuff works though.",2024-04-14 03:08:45,2
"Used to be good for viewing content while not at home or while the internet's down, but now there's a problem with the audio, and a lot of visual stutter with resuming video (some of the episodes I watch are essentially 2 episodes in 1 as half length, hence pausing in the middle is still stopping between episodes, and definitely no fun to try to restart and then get back to the spot like that).",2024-03-18 07:23:06,2

The interface on mobile is now awful, but especially: the extra sidebar that pops up when you try to click for more info, has *specific letters blurred out*, as if they're censoring swear words [D, g, o, and others], making it impossible to read.

They should at least waive the fee until the year is up. Shady.",2024-03-03 12:53:22,1
Up until yesterday 2/25/2024 I've never had an issue casting my prime video to my chomecast or other casting devices. It appears the app updated. I depend on the app to cast because I have an older TV. If this current update is going to eliminate my viewing ability on my TV then the customer I've been to Amazon for the last several year is going in the trash.,2024-02-27 04:39:57,1
"Used to be great! Now it sucks... Amazon used to charge $99 anually. It's now $139 and they want you to pay an extra 2.99/mo more for no commercials now, there's no more prime button. Most of what's on the home screen is now pay per view or subscription channels. Severely reduced free Amazon prime videos. Just plain corporate greed!!!!",2024-02-14 21:10:36,3
"Missing important functionality. Their subscription channels lack the full content of subscribing directly from the source. So tired of starting to watch dubbed seasons of shows and finding out halfway through the dubbing just ends. However, if you subscribe directly from Crunchyroll, all the shows episodes are dubbed. But if you get the Crunchyroll subscription through Amazon some aren't. Used to be random episodes but just ran into a second half of a season that's missing.",2024-02-09 23:31:07,1
"Well... great move adding ads for Prime members. Really appreciate the nickle and dime strategies. The proliferation of this policy is getting old. Not worth my time anymore. You should really reduce the prime main subscription every time you do things like this because you've essentially taken away a benefit of that subscription with this and similar policies. Good luck with your ethical dilemma... oh wait, prime main sub went up lol (2 stars for range of options, -3 for the rest)",2024-02-07 04:25:49,2
"Sigh, same as everyobe else, im annoyed that theyre charging to remove ads from a sevice i already pay for, and im also annoyed that the subtitles NEVER work correctly, no matter the device and often have typos. Sometimes a show will say it has audio/subtitles in multiple languages and then... just doesnt. Oh, and be prepared for High-Speed 4K ads and then 10-90 seconds of staring at your reflection in a black screen while the audio of your show continues to play.",2024-02-27 18:54:58,1
"I continually hit an issue where my last place in a show was forgotten. I then have to start the episode over and watch ads, okay no issue on those intros. Then when I fast forward back to my spot, I'm having to watch more ads during those break sequences. I'm watching almost 2 min of ads and still haven't yet returned to my past position.",2024-02-21 17:48:06,1
"It's great that as Prime video loses more and more licensed content, it's adding ads. So a crappier experience, and also less valuable! Wow, that's 👍 Update: Couldn't do Watch Party with my buds on a ""Free with Prime"" movie because there was no pay option available, which is now a hard-coded requirement for WP. I swear you guys are freaking geniuses over there, just leaning into enshitification full steam, eh?",2024-02-19 03:47:44,1
"The app it's self works fine, but I'm not a fan of the rewind/fast forward feature on any platform, it's buggy and doesn't work right. This isn't a big deal but my main gripe is that, on any platform, tv, app, website, the commercials are so loud. I end up muting the TV whenever they come on. This is a violation of fcc rules.",2024-02-13 14:53:55,2
Constant issues and slow or glitchy playback even on Wi-Fi. The download feature barely works often not downloading properly if at all being stuck on 0% for hours before starting and once the download finishes you often have to have service or the app won't recognize your account which defeats the purpose of downloads in the first place........ If I have service I can stream I don't need downloads.... These things would be acceptable a decade ago but in 2024 they are just lazy and unjustifiable,2024-02-10 00:49:10,1
Great except ... They are always begging for you to rate the app. The included with prime shows are minimal small budget films for the most part and most any notable show you have to pay for a different Channel service that costs as much as another streaming service. And that is on top of what you already pay for prime. PRIME VIDEO USED TO BE MY FAVORITE. Now they are just price gouging you any where possible. It's basically just an FU everyday.,2024-03-19 18:52:49,3
"Love the app...don't love that I pay for a membership and still have to buy or rent most movies and shows offered, also don't like that even if you buy something it seems that they will still take it off the app or make you buy it again later down the line. Really don't like that physical copies are a thing of the past, I see this becoming more and more restrictive in what we are given.",2024-03-07 17:01:50,3
"Ads... Since they've been added, I find myself exiting the app to watch something else. Making me wonder if Prime is worth it anymore, they keep increasing the price and reducing services... Will need to examine usage and see if worth it anymore.... Good job Amazon, probably wouldn't have even considered cancelling if not for ads.... Know that if I do cancel, ads is the primary reason.",2024-02-26 06:11:52,2
"love it, easy to use and no issues. Also, if you take a bit of time to search, there are so many gems on here, especially from independent studios, it's well worth a try. To be honest, the content, whether it be ""new"" or, as said, a hidden gem, just keeps getting better and this is why it's my ""go to"" streaming platform. Yes, there's adverts now if you don't pay the extra, but personally, haven't found them intrusive - think ""Freevee"", but a little bit less.",2024-04-23 18:57:34,5
"The ads. It's unbelievable, turning a streaming platform, which was not great no begin with, into a TV network! And they obviously don't work as intended either... If you exit full screen while a show is playing, and replay the episode seconds later, the ads restart!!! And if you pass the ads shown at the middle of the episode, and then decide to back up (because you missed something or want to rewatch a specific part of said episode), the ads will pop-up again for no reason!",2024-04-21 09:48:51,1
"it is a five star app, there are a few things which it needs: - On a laptop within ChromeOS the 'Next Episode' or 'Recap Skip' need to not disappear when you move the mouse across the screen. - The filter and search to find content needs some work, as there are so few options to discover new options other than searching for it, or letting the algorithem find out for you. - There isn't a way to clear the currently watching list, if you decide its not for you. I've got films and TV series stuck",2024-04-11 13:22:56,5
"Difficult yo use. UI is not user friendly. I'm a Netflix user n recently start using prime videos but missing some features very badly. 1. I can't fix brightness while watching. 2.

Next episode button shows too late.",2024-04-25 00:00:25,2
"Some shows are good but having to watch ads for a service you pay for is idiotic. I will not keep this app for long as a result. The entire point of me getting these streaming services was because I didn't want to see ads, and now I gotta pay extra for that? Bad. Bad ideas. Bad ads. Some truly terrible shows Couple of good ones. Good Omens, The Tick, The Boys, Invincible, Fallout.

"I rarely use it but every time I do it is a painful experience. The fact that a movie or show can't be bought directly via this app and have to use Amazon website/app is baffling.

Never had such a bad experience with other streaming platforms.",2024-04-20 16:35:35,2
"Hi Product Manager/ Developers for this team 1. Few issues I faced here in this app while playing the video for the first time the video starts , but the screen remain black for some moments. 2. While playing the video after the pause the video doesn't render quickly like Netflix, like if you play the video after pausing the screen was stuck at same frame, but the audio was playing after 5-10 seconds the video and audio both synchronised, hope you fix this issues.",2024-04-24 10:04:26,3
"Ridiculous, there's no reason to not just make a singular plan including the ad free option, in fact, it might make more money. Besides from their original movies/series, the selection is absolutley horribe and you'll need to pay upwards of $5 USD to watch something decent. I travel a lot. No matter where I am if it's dubai or belgium, if you don't have anything downloaded and the internet looses a single bar your film turns into an 8bit game. You're better off using sketchy free movie links.",2024-04-23 18:59:21,1
Over the years I have not appreciated the frequent changes to the selection screen. All I really need is a proper summary of the movie and the IMDb information. Users comments may also contain relevant information. I do not need huge images that fill the screen and offer little of value other than Holywood'esque aesthetic. Why is everything much harder than it needs to be. Limited subtitles in the app compared to desktop site. Rubbish.,2024-04-23 16:55:36,1
"App is quite good filled with lot of informations about the cast & the trivia. That's fine. But the Player controls must be improved, such as * Volume Controls just by sliding the screen * Brightness adjustment by sliding the screen * Double tap FF & FR for 10s * Toggling of HD in the app is little bit difficult. The seeker is getting adjusted.",2024-04-24 11:27:48,3
"The TV app works worst than a local video player. It should at least have good interface, fast, easy reverse and forward option similar to hotstar and netflix. I understand these are your compitators but at least we can do better seeing at other apps. More over the TV app is tooooo slow where we click to pause and it reacts after 5-10 seconds.

"This is a pretty good app for finding something interesting and different to watch, as well as having some great original series- Good Omens, The Boys etc. I'm a bit fed up that they now want to increase the subscription price so you don't have adverts- this was meant to be a benefit of having a Prime account as opposed to a stand alone subscription streaming service, so it seems a bit mean, as well as having to pay to buy or rent series or movies, also at full price, hence the 4 stars.",2024-04-15 15:17:34,4
"It has a lot of bugs in the app, like: When we pause a series, and then we come back to the app to continue to watch, it comes back for a previous episode; sometimes it has the button skip intro and sometimes not; when we reduce the screen to watch the series while typing a message, the subtitle disappears. Greaaat catalog, however the app needs a lot of work to fix these bugs.",2024-04-16 03:19:54,2
"I love the catalog, I like catching up with tv series I didn't grow up on that I find gold now. HOWEVER, this app sucks due to the main reason that it won't even give me the highest resolution for viewing. Sure, u could adjust it to 1080p from the settings but it seems that it would always adjust the quality based on your wifi strength. And even if it's strong, u still couldn't get that 1080p that you're looking for. It's set as 1080p but you'll see it as 720p. Sorry Prime, I might cancel soon.",2024-04-04 14:04:02,2
"Forcing us to watch ads is RIDICULOUS when we're already paying a subscription. Also, the interface sucks. We've been watching ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and whenever we click on continue watching, it takes us to the last episode of season 1, so we have to go back, choose season 3 and look for the episode where we left off. Again, shame on you Amazon for forcing subscribers to pay in order not to watch ads; I would understand that if it were a free app, but we're already paying a lot!",2024-04-20 05:23:34,1
"Generally a good app. Most things work well and it's got some nice features to do with what your watching such as cast information and I like that it shows the IMDB rating for each show. Watchlist is hidden away under yoir profile somewhere and it would be better if this is on the home screen. Can be difficult to browse as well, needs better suggestions/sorting.",2024-04-22 18:14:16,4
"I've used on several devices and the set top box, it forever freezes like its buffering, then it'll play a few seconds before freezing again so you have to shut the app down and start again.

"Can't view my already purchased items from other devices, or purchase new ones on the app. Ads are horrific, there should have been a cheaper tier with ads rather than adding them to an already premium service. They also freeze and crash the entire app. Trying to watch the premiere of Fallout tookv me 3 attempts as the last ad wouldn't load. Feel like I'm being taken advantage of, losing a service I've already paid for.",2024-04-12 15:23:45,1
Really frustrating that they've decided to add unskippable ads before everything you try and watch. I pay for a subscription why for the love of everything do I have to deal with rubbish ads I don't care about! If anything I am far less likely to watch anything that is advertised because it's actively stopping me watching the thing I actually want to watch. Full of pretty mediocre content as well. Looked for a horror movie today and couldn't find anything with a rating over 3 on IMDb.,2024-04-06 22:35:55,1
Now have ads or call it commercials. Regardless. Why do you play at twice the volume of show and movies. Adjusted my tv and device not to do it for and works for all but you. But yours is hard wired in to be much higher decibals. If continues cancelling. I am not turning off volume each time an ad comes on. No need for double volume. This alone will force me to cancel. I want to hear my shows not listen to extremly loud commercials. Other services I pay for allow this why is yours not?,2024-04-16 12:57:01,1
"This is a mediocre app. The scan function only skips 10 seconds forward or backwards, and there is too much delay, making it difficult to find the right place to stop. On my Samsung Galaxy s24, the framerate stutters at random times. And the nonsense way it mixes content included in Prime with content you must pay for, as well as content from other platforms like Paramount, is confusing.",2024-04-10 13:27:56,3
It always feels a little underwhelming. It never seems to show my continue watching due to the amount of rent or buy bits I tend to miss things I would probably want to watch and the adverts don't bother me too much as I'm not paying another £36 a year but for example i missed the last 10 mins of an episode. I watch an advert at the start of the video and then skip to the point I want only to watch another advert because it's past half way. Piracy makes things so much easier.,2024-04-10 16:42:19,3
"Paying for Advertisements Commercials... It's alright for browsing if you're bored and don't care just toss something on in the background, but if you want to watch something you see and get so many Advertisements throughout a show or a movie it really sucks... that's the only big downfall for me. Not to mention it's basically for browsing just to find something new to watch aswell for example a new show to watch cause you finished your last show or find a random good movie.",2024-04-23 14:00:32,2
"Not well organized, incomplete seasons, clunky, buggy as hell (sometimes the video is completely black when playing back to back videos) and they have the audacity to put commercials in the middle of the content for a membership i already paid fully like they need the money to justify a mediocre app that works...but the experience of using it is annoying.",2024-04-22 17:31:24,1
"So many ads on the ""ad free"" version. After purchasing the ""ad free"" option I found out that most things seem to be excluded from it and still have ads.

At least other platforms that have added ads actually remove them in the ad free option.",2024-04-13 19:31:50,1
"Used to be good but then after streaming killed cable they now have ads, wouldn't be surprised if it gets worse in the next few years.

Should be set default for confirmation.",2024-04-17 21:47:11,2
"Good programming, but one time I ran out of data, and watching three movies used 35 gigs in two days. When I looked into my usage, I noticed that one of them had downloaded twice. My phone provider was good enough to increase my account data in order to prevent me from having to pay a ton of extra data fees. While I didn't have my settings to the lowest setting, clearly there was an over usage by Prime, but the CS Reps had no way to compensate me. Otherwise it's great. Great selections. :)",2024-02-18 03:24:14,3
"It's a good service, as in the layout, navigation, search etc is fairly well done! Problem is the content, yeah it has some good stuff, but for me not enough! Lots to choose from, but added costs just really suck. And now, to top it off, Amazon have decided they don't have enough money so they have plastered ads all over the place. Greed always gets to us, bezos and his empire are no different.",2024-02-21 21:43:33,3
"App is good, but have few things to be fixed. 1) When you open any video, it doesn't go automatically in full screen mode, have to manually do it everytime. 2) You can't get the video streched end to end of screen, the zoom option just zooms the video which results in picture getting cut. I request you to please fix these if possible. Thanks.",2024-04-06 04:33:15,3
"It was a great app until they decided to start putting ads into your watching experience. Sometimes you have up to three ads that appear as commercials in between episodes during episodes or during movies. Very unhappy with this, Usually you watch the same ad twice. They now require you to pay an extra fee to get rid of the ads. Amazon makes enough money. They don't need to charge you anymore money.",2024-03-05 21:18:38,2
"As video apps go, it's very comprehensive and straightforward to use. Not pleased about the adverts that have been introduced, or about the fact I can't buy or rent titles through the app and have to use an Internet browser instead. There also doesn't feel like there's been as much new content of quality for over a year included in prime and so find myself forced to subscribe to more channels. Overall not bad, but not as much value for money as there once was.",2024-03-24 00:08:26,3
"X-ray is bad. I'm sure some people like it, but it's very intrusive to the experience of watching movies & shows. It seems to have gotten worse lately. Recently video quality of Amazon Prime Video on my PC seemed lower, and so compared it to my phone. Quality on my phone was better, but at the same time, X-Ray won't ""F"" off. I'm sure some manager or design guru thinks it's great, but it needs to be controllable with a setting. I hate it more than the low quality. It's driving me to stop paying!",2024-02-13 23:55:35,3
"Amazon prime is decent, but the problem is that people are paying for this and there are still unskippable adverts. Obviously, you can pay to skip them, but let's me honest no one will.

"Most films are without the original version language. Pointless. If a film is originally English I want to watch it in English and add subtitles. Netflix does it, it can't cost Amazon any extra, why doesn't Prime? The constant trailers, even though it's turned off, is a huge annoyance. Aside from that, as a 25 years experienced programmer, the app is clunky with no real UX dev or skill involved. Typical of low investment. Now add adverts to the mix. PURE DISGUSTING GREED.",2024-02-17 00:07:34,1
Most of the features and on-demand work quite well. I just don't care for the rental/buy options and connections to other paid services. Languages are also an issue for me as I can not filter by what I can understand. There are quite a few I wanted to watch but are NOT offered my language. I also have a hard time with paying for a service but getting ads.,2024-03-12 01:23:31,2
"I've had to take off some stars due to adverts. I'm all for adverts, I'd rather them than price rises. However, they need a better system. If I've watched adverts during an episode, I shouldn't have to watch them again when I return to that episode after closing the app. Whilst trying to squeeze in a 45-ish minute episode during my commute to work, I had to watch adverts 4 times. Makes it less useful on the go. Which is generally how I use Prime.",2024-03-24 10:52:30,3
The unskippable ads are so annoying now. Every 5 mins during a movie. What am I paying for at this point. Its become far more convenient to go elsewhere than to pay for this anymore. I can see netflix going the same way if they integrate more annoying things that take the whole point of using it away. Wouldnt recommend anymore. Might as well get a TV package with your broadband as everything's going the same way anyway. Such a shame.,2024-02-22 10:36:18,1
"Was a good app, but with recent changes it's just going downhill. Ads were added, sometimes 3 ad breaks at 2 min a piece in one 20-30 min episode. Selection has become very limited. Unless, you guessed it, pay yet another subscription fee to a service provider on their platform. It's just costing more and more at every turn now for very limited service. Will be switching services as soon as decide on which one to switch to.",2024-03-13 16:54:33,2
"Worst of the lot. It never remembers where I am in a series. It's a paid for service, but they force adverts onto you for shows you don't want to watch. Using a VPN in the same country I'm subscribed in flags an alert and locks you out. There is no screen lock. Brightness needs to be adjusted in your phones app. Volume needs to be adjusted on your phone. Both of these functions should just be touch sliders on the screen.

Used to be good. Suddenly want extra money to not see ads even though I pay £95 for prime already. Can no longer recommend this service that I previously would have recommended. It's very expensive to then have to see ads even though it's a premium private prepaid service. What is the world coming to? A couple of my friends have cancelled and I'm gonna do the same. Can't really work out what I'm paying £95 for! I doubt Amazon will make money from this extra cost as many people will just cancel,2024-02-24 22:55:00,1

If I wanted commercials, I'd go back to cable. At first, it was a 12 second ad, and then it was two 12 second ads together. Then a 12-second plus 30-second. Now it's multiple 30-second ads together. No wonder there's a lawsuit in the states over this. Hopefully they start one in Canada.",2024-03-04 23:07:19,1

It would be nice to have the seasons of shows that are several seasons ahead, I mean one season behind the rest of the world is one thing but more than three is mind boggling.

"If I could give this 0 Stars, I would. Let's start with ever increasing pricing while the value of service or product is constantly decreasing. Paying more than double the initial price and getting spammed by ads and more avenues to pay more and more is really irritating. After implementing an ""ads-free""-Tier, this product has become unwatchable without shilling out more money. Most of the shows and movies worth watching are rent/buy anyways. Would never recommend, abhorrent wallet-squeeze!",2024-04-03 13:15:20,1
"Hi, i have been having trouble paying for subscriptions. My subscription automatically deducts payment through Google Play. It has worked for me for multiple months. But it still show I'm not subscribed. Not only automatic deductions have been done, I have to pay using my card again. No refunds have been issued and this happened for the second month now. For me to continue using my subscription i have to pay twice since last month.",2024-03-14 00:46:23,1
"Now you have to pay for ads and their recommended videos are literally ones from the genre I downvoted and ""hide this"" option selected (multiple 100s of them). They are literally forcing you to watch their own selection of programs regardless of what you do. Disgusting, waiting for my account to expire and going back to Netflix or look for something else. Download Tubi, just like Prime Video Canada, not the greatest programing with ads, but its FREE.",2024-02-10 05:13:27,1
"Most of the content you actually want to watch is not included. I already pay for the subscription I don't won't to pay more. Also there is no way to cancel in the app. It is designed to make it hard for you to cancel. If you go to manage your subscription it wants you to log in again. It then takes you to a useless screen telling you the 'benefits' if your subscription. Then once you find the button that is supposed to take you to the cancelation page, big surprise here the page doesn't exist.",2024-03-19 02:19:48,1

Every time you click to read details of a movie, then go back, it takes you back to the top of the list, rather than where you were when you clicked on the movie. This is really annoying, along with confusing and poor organisation of movies. I would have expected much better from such a huge company.

"This was a decent app until unskippable ads were shoehorned in in a bid to make bigger profits. It's bad enough to have 30 seconds at the beginning. At least then I know it's coming and I can do something useful with the time while the sound is muted. But ads also appear randomly during the content. This is now just pay TV, not a video streaming service. On the plus side, I'll spend less time watching since I won't use Amazon anymore.",2024-03-07 10:31:09,1

I now have to watch stupid ads on things I've paid for outside of my Prime subscription and I keep getting told this shouldn't happen but no one can fix it!

Months can go by that I won't shop and utilize next day shipping, but at least I knew we were watching movies on Prime so that was OK.

"Quite simple, the extra fee for an ad-free Amazon Prime is absolutely ridiculous. It's not like the range of movies/TV shows are that great to begin with (Germany) and the lack of English subtitles is another whole issue as well.

Any good TV shows only have 1st couple of seasons available for 'free'. And always asking me to buy additional subscriptions! It just wants more of your cash!",2024-03-23 08:31:24,1

There are much better streaming apps that take a monthly fee and give you the whole content for that amount.

There are so many great options to choose from I don't need cable or any other apps like Netflix....,2024-04-23 04:56:02,5
I pay $130 a year for Amazon Prime and I can't watch most things without paying even more!? On top of that I have to pay $3 extra for add free? Jfc. We already sent you to space Jeff. What more do you want!? User interface is the worst of all platforms. 2 stars because Fallout is pretty decent compared to other live action adaptations.,2024-04-20 18:43:08,2

I wish I could leave 1 star. I hate that with the new update I cant purchase movies or TV shows on the app on my phone. I have to go to the internet browser to do so. Come on Amazon.

I feel like the brightness for the prime video app is very low. Another observation is that I feel that the app is a bit slow then Netflix. Also this is really important suggestion but please reduce the amount of rented movies and please include them in the subscription as there are tons of premium movies that I want to watch but I can't due to them having a rent option Please consider the above suggestions that make it happen Amazon!!!!!!!,2024-04-03 07:42:51,3

I jack the volume on my tv to 100 % and I still can't hear a damn thing while on Tubi the volume on my tv only needs to be at 15%. Plus the content they keep adding is just the worst garbage on Earth. I absolutely hate Prime! At least it is free with the overall Prime subscription, it is still awful and now ads",2024-04-12 05:17:22,1
"The concept is good, however the app throws out useless ads. I don't want to pay for ads playing after every second episode. Another thing, the series' seasons are displayed seperately, which sucks big time. Netflix doesn't have your shows that's why I paid. Change this and I'll give you a 5 star review.",2024-04-15 14:44:56,2
"When I think about which streaming service I ought to cancel, prime video tops the list. Trailer ads and a liberal scattering of rent or buy titles throughout like landmines dispense disappointment at regular intervals. Technically sound, it has a selection of great shows and features which have forestalled me dropping the platform entirely but out of all my subscriptions it will definitely be the first to go.",2024-02-13 13:03:10,3
"This app is terrible! I watch shows at night and often fall asleep. When I log in, I need to skip back. The problem is that I have to watch a round of commercials when I log in, then another round of commercials when I skip back, only to realize that I am still not in the right spot and have to watch another round of commercials to skip back again.

When I looked it up this appears to be a common problem",2024-04-03 16:09:34,2
Absolutely stunning quality in every aspect. Haven't found anything to complain about in the slightest Edit: I take it back. The only issue I've found is from trying to download episodes. I keep getting met with an error. It's not my phone or service. Everything else downloads fine no matter how little signal I've got,2024-04-17 05:23:27,4
"My biggest problem with this app is that it doesn't accurately keep you at the right spot in TV shows or movies you are watching. The absolute worst is when it skipped to the very last episode of a TV show I was watching, completely spoiling the ending, I was beyond disappointed. The TV and movie selection is okay, but not great. Overall, there is a lot of room for improvement.",2024-03-25 23:45:54,2
"No longer getting any access on my TV for Prime Video. Started with bad buffering, shutting down and now just a blank screen. It has steadily gotten worse over the last few months.

"Watching the ads is a pain for a service that's already paid for, but when the app crashes, or you accidentally skip ahead/behind, or leave the app for a short period of time, and then have to watch the few minutes of ads again... it starts to feel intentional. Being bullied into paying more to avoid annoyance.",2024-04-10 05:54:59,2
"As many users have suggested, and I am also recommending, adding BRIGHTNESS and VOLUME sliders is essential because this is a video app, and it will be necessary in 2024 for any video app to have them. Moreover, there is a significant lack of variety, such as shows like ""Friends"" being unavailable. Even after purchasing an annual subscription, having to pay rental and subscription fees is quite disappointing.",2024-04-22 06:44:56,1
"Prime video is the only streaming service that doesn't support Chromecast to my nest hubs, meaning that I can only cast to my TV with it. It also frequently glitches when casting - the screen goes green and purple for a few seconds - which is extremely annoying! Given that we're now paying for the service AND being served ads, it's very disappointing that it doesn't even work properly.",2024-03-26 18:10:33,1
Every time I view the ads the show loads in and the screen turns black and doesn't play the video. I close the app and open it up to try again and I have to watch ads and then the screen turns black when the show starts. This app lets me watch advertisements and nothing else,2024-04-10 22:20:04,1
"No option to buy shows in-app. Have to receive an email which then takes you to the store page where it can be purchased. App has trouble casting (uncommon, but it happens) to chromecast.

"April 17, 2924 update... Worthless app, since you can't really watch videos as it is supposed to be for. Lots of negative reviews, and the updates don't fix the problems. Original review: Disappointed with the update. It no longer plays downloaded video well. Lots of buffering, and I only see the subtitles . I later learned turning off Auto Downloads helped. The next day, couldn't watch anything! Is it possible to revert to the earlier version?",2024-04-17 14:22:13,1
"Visual and audio horror show. Everything I watch keeps having frame rate issues that magically fix if I tap the screen and then it'll happen again 10 seconds later. Not a great viewing experience. Then when I use my Bluetooth earbuds (Samsung buds FE) the audio will automatically lower to almost inaudible until someone talks and then it'll come up again, only to lower again when there's no dialogue. So background music and noise is always dimmed until someone speaks. Super bizarre",2024-04-17 02:33:47,1
"Overall great and well run app on my phone, but on the Smart TV can be hugely problematic at times. Also, I've been with Prime since it came out and they still haven't fixed the persistent subtitle issues with non-English speaking films that they were ""aware of and working to fix"" back when I first signed up with them. Purely as a phone app its 3.5 stars allowing for the subtitle issue, but considering it's long phases of unreliability on the TV it has to go lower again.",2024-03-01 09:06:53,2
Not great overall. The paid content in between free content is annoying. Then when watching series a lot of prime content goes on to show season spoilers without having a skip button present (need to find it in the top right menu). Also the brightness seems less than other streaming apps. Prime seems to depend on android system brightness while other apps allow you to control this from the video menu. Seems dimmer though even on full brightness.,2024-02-16 14:11:46,3
Doesn't work. If I binge watch a show it eventually stops showing the image for that show and after a dew minutes will kick me out. If I try going to a different show it works perfectly fine and will only not play the one I intend to watch. Eben the ads for the show that won't work show perfectly fine. The app let's me watch all the ads before informing that the show doesn't work. When it doesn't kick me out it only plays the audio.,2024-04-04 13:01:23,2
"This was a 4/5 star before the mid roll ads. the UI is fine, some features would be nice such as: browsing whilst watching, clicking on an actor and a list of their films popping up, a tidier home page etc etc. However, unless you also use prime for the shopping perks, this is now a service I wouldn't recommend to people due to the obscene new ad features. Around 5-10 minutes total of ads throughout a film, unskippable, with a paywall to remove them which is just a little too much money.",2024-02-27 13:47:29,3
"It's slow! When u have to rewind ⏪ or forward ⏩ it takes ages to get back on track!

Hands down one of the best streaming apps ever made. Prime video is the most inclusive streaming app ever. You can stream prime original shows and movies while renting in theater movies or you can connect other streaming services to prime like paramount plus and max. And on top of all that you can rent or buy thousands of movies and tv shows or watch the free selections that it offers so you always have something to watch.,2024-04-04 18:52:03,5
I like the top section that lets us return to programs we hadn't finished watching. The section that lets us link to channels we subscribe to is helpful. The app could be improved by moving our watch list after subscriptions. I find it hard to know what follows the subscriptions list. Using the subs section as a template with sections instead of channels would make a big difference.,2024-03-24 02:40:02,4
MAJOR ISSUE. App is great on TV but as a phone app it is unusable. Constant stuttering and buffering on audio and video which makes anything unwatchable. I've even tried downloading the shows to no solution. All troubleshooting online does not help.

Not to mention a lot of tv series have a ""not availible at this time"" so you can only watch some or part of a show and if you live in select countries you can't rent or buy anything. Not to mentioned AP increased there fees, so here in NZ we pay more for less than what other countries receive. Such a waste.",2024-04-23 02:34:53,2

But why it keep getting so damn dark you can't see anything that it's pointless how good something is to watch on there when half the movie goes back to where can't even watch it.

Trouble watching programs from my paid subscriptions. In Canada and I have paramount and AMC plus and often the program has aired and should be available but it isn't. Sometimes it seems it's trying to use the US availability in the app so won't allow me access. Gas happened with both subscriptions and it gets incredibly frustrating. I've tried to get support but that was even more frustrating and useless.,2024-04-10 05:15:25,2
I am not happy with the option and contains available it's very boring app I feel as there are hardly any update on recent movies or choice available . it's unlike other app who ask for annual subscription and then whole year you wait and wait for some interesting update to watch for. better to have a cable operator those are much cheaper then this applications..,2024-04-13 15:08:20,3

Could be better tbh.",2024-03-06 17:02:10,3

I hope you can make the app as enjoyable as it used to be",2024-04-19 13:02:06,3

Freevee is not the Prime service I pay for. I did not buy Amazon Prime so that I could be spammed for other subscriptions. And now you've taken away the filters so that I can't even find the comment I paid for. You need to revert prime video to what it was several years ago. I won't be renewing with you again the way this is going. Let me easily access the content I pay for or no more money for Amazon.

I watch at least 8 full length movies each month, and at least 15 or more hour-long episodes of various shows (all in the comfort & quiet of my home) and ALL of that for less than it would cost to go to just one movie in a theatre! Check it out! 💯",2024-04-20 19:16:29,5
"Poor - no good films and even the mediocre stuff has ads now 👎 Originally, I got it as a nice extra with prime delivery but then they started advertising paid films everywhere making for a tiresome user experience. Dropping yet more ads on the stuff that was free was the final straw. Amazon makes enough monet without having to bleed its customers for every drop of blood.",2024-02-28 21:54:46,1
"ads... seriously?? This is the slippery slope i always said would happen and push people back into pirating. First it was a few streaming video services... now you need many to watch everything, which is getting costly... and now ... ADS... this is Cable/Digital/Satellite all over again. add this package add that package, go ad free for this fee... i will likely cancel before the trial ends. Not paying for ads. I'd just as soon not watch anything, than watch ads at all.",2024-03-24 20:38:01,1
"You have made for yourselves here a very commendable catalogue. I'm intrigued. It brings me great pleasure to explore as much as I can. Who knows what hidden gems I might uncover, stories yet untold, discoveries that might change who I am, who I want to be..(was that cheesy. Okay, maybe that was super cheesy :). The app is quite good though in a nutshell. Works like a charm.",2024-04-24 20:34:32,4
"Unsatisfied Experience Despite stating that the adverts will be limited, the app still displays ads during movie playback, which is frustrating. This is particularly unacceptable given the monthly subscription fee. YouTube, where ads can be skipped and content is free, offers a better experience. Amazon Prime's competitiveness against Netflix is dwindling, and they risk losing their customer base if improvements aren't made soon.",2024-03-17 00:15:22,1
"The new Prime with adds is absolutely horrible, not only fails to deliver as promised next day when it comes to order in Amazon but now we have to watch adds, once my subscription it's over I am done, if i have to watch adds I would rather use Tubi or Roku that are free! I honestly will make it my mission to not buy anything they advertise or mute the volume when the adds come.",2024-04-18 12:22:20,1
A streaming app with some good original content. You will encounter so many bugs and errors. The x-ray really improves shows and movies for me. Keeps asking me to continuoally review it after I have. Also streams in low quality even with a current phone and amazing wifi,2024-04-07 23:28:00,2
"Very bad experience with video playback whenever I touch screen annoying x ray tab comes very bad experience 😞 i can't use skip this annoying IMDb tab comes actors names remove it , whoever wants to know actors can search or add another option remove it while in playback mode , downloading movies in best is only 400 mb movie what type of video i want full 4 gb of videos and it's just 720p video in high quality",2024-04-08 09:34:11,2
"Negative: Download time is very long and often freezes halfway through, especially if downloading multiple things at once. New screen format as of spring 2024 isn't automatically full screen. Mixes up available content with unavailable content so its library feels unreliable. Positive: Does do picture in picture and moves straight to the next episode without having to return to the app.",2024-04-18 13:46:53,2
Suddenly ads are getting played in middle of the episode that is very irritating also once the ad is completed the video is going blank and only audio is being heard. If I drag the video 10 sec back then again ad comes up and again screen goes blank. So basically ad is making screen go blank and after ad only audio is heard,2024-04-11 07:28:38,2
"This app used to be good. Now I'm bombarded with adverts every 15 minutes. It's like having a tv in the 90's. It's making me hate prime so much. I get the vids that say they have adds. But even the ones supposedly add free, now have effing adverts. Amazon. Sort it out. You don't have that many good shows to warrant this much annoyance. Update. Cancelled my sub. 5 minutes in to a show and in comes another unskippable ad. Enough is enough. I'm done. Streaming should be easy.",2024-03-17 00:59:33,1
I used to enjoy the app. I'm not a fan of the commercials. It's not an experience I enjoy as it distracts from the movie. I've decided to boycott the products and the companies that are advertising. I have noticed a considerable amount of glitches recently as well. Sometimes the film is attempting to catch up with the voices sometimes it's the reverse of the voices catching up with the film.,2024-04-03 01:34:07,2
The app itself s slowly becoming better and more stable than previous iterations. Key features I'm looking forward to; Brightnesses control - it feels really clunky on my less powerful tablet to open system settings to pull up brightnesses controls and ajust accordingly. A back button during video playback - the screen is littered with some really great options but no actual way to return to previous screen. It's a small but useful feature that I take for granted on other streaming apps.,2024-03-23 13:23:34,3
"I have complained to Amazon about videos freezing, lagging and then cutting off. Nothing has changed even after all the troubleshooting and it doesn't happen with any other streaming platform on my phone. Seems fine on TV but on my android devices it's terrible. I was also told customer service eould get back to me within 48 hours and that was weeks ago. Not good at all and especially when I pay for extra channels. Get it fixed or I'm out.",2024-03-14 21:58:25,1
"Thank you for fixing the problem with missing paid channels. Prime is changing with adding other channels with commercials. Hulu and Netflix don't have that junk, why do you. Amazon Prime has fallen behind the other applications we go to for entertainment. Stop trying to fix something that wasn't broken until you started messing with it.",2024-04-17 10:33:21,4
"After a few hours, the app turns my phone completely off. I tried deleting and re-downloading it or resetting my phone entirely, but it still does the same thing. I find it really annoying when trying to watch something or just have it for background noise.",2024-04-23 05:08:09,3
"Does its job but with significant flaws. For example, instead of being able to toggle full screen, you HAVE TO rotate your screen. Also, when you're online and choose a downloaded title, it jumps to ""episodes"" instead of playing the selected video.",2024-04-21 23:14:54,3
"Ummm, downloads not working after update. I would give this app a pretty good review overall, but I'm supposed to be able to download 25 videos (I have 16 downloaded and 30 gigs available) and for some reason it refuses to download ANY shows or movies. Sucks because I have to go into town to download them since I have no service where I live. Fixing this will change my review. One star.",2024-04-11 23:17:32,1
"Commands within a movie/episode take a long time to react (pause, rewind, etc.). It does not always work with ChromeCast. Only some movies/shows have trailers, so you don't always know the quality of what you are about to watch, and a lot of the good stuff requires extra subscriptions. But so far, at least, the commercials are minimal.",2024-03-12 04:03:36,3
I am not sure what it is about the Prime interface but I have never liked it (and thought it was just because I am not techy so I am not great with online stuff) but I was talking to my bestie who's a tech whiz and she hates it too. Netflix has a much better layout and is more intuitive. I almost never us Prime or the APP for this reason. It was like this when they started but they have never updated the layout!,2024-03-03 00:24:15,2
App would t stay in landscape mode during movie also still get commercials even though I paid extra for them bot to be on just at beg but still. Also very difficult to get technical support or even call them. Have to call customer support for all of Amazon. Should be just a phone number and staff just for the Amazon prime. And way to much to try and find help in app. For my issue non. Hopefully re installation app will help,2024-04-05 03:32:27,2
"Good but Netflix app is much better, or any video software, such as VLCmedia player the past 15 years. Its oblivious that they didnt figure the basic stuff out yet. Who are they hiring? 2 stars cause I could watch the video in HD quality most of the time. Cheers. PS.: if you hire me, you beat Netflix, gl out there Amazon!",2024-04-18 10:11:38,2
"It's constantly getting more expensive - since we use free shipping only we're not going that route with you, Amazon, anymore. It's starts with a small amount and soon we're ending up like Netflix and we're constantly spending more and more for -for me- no extra use. I quit here and see how this goes, first. Started one video - instantly got two ads. Not with me. 💁🏻‍♂️",2024-02-19 12:33:36,1
"Awful, subtitles not working, even trying 3 different languages, every time I change the subtitles language, the video exits full screen making me have to go back to see what I missed, it's also showing 1 min of ads even tho I PAY to not have to watch ads. I'm pretty sure Amazon isn't going bankrupt so I can't imagine a reason for this much decrease in quality.",2024-02-14 23:42:23,1
"Lately app crashes both my phone and tablet. Takes forever to load videos. Many times it never does. Have had to restart my phone three times today because prime keeps locking up my entire phone somehow. Oh, and there are commercials now too. Its just like having cable. Absolute pain in the *** app. Also even tho I'm paying for the subscription, half the content is still behind an ADDITIONAL paywall. Uninstalled and unsubscribed. I am SO sick of Amazon's greed.",2024-02-24 00:14:22,1
"You already had to sub to other services or rent a lot of content you wanted to watch. Then, they added ads at the beginning of videos you wanted to watch. NOW you are FORCED to watch ads on a service that you PAY for BECAUSE you don't want to watch ads. It's complete garbage now. How is it any better than finding any old site to watch on that, while you might have to put up with an ad, is at least otherwise free? Money-grubbing jerks at Amazon.",2024-03-25 20:47:33,1
"So many adds in the middle of the show, that is quite annoying. Too many shows are categorized as rent or buy, which means pay again, although we already have paid subscription to amazon prime. Each new category amazon makes, asks for a new fee, or subscription or....although it's still the same company. Not sure how much longer ill be an amazon customer if all the above continues. I am Not a happy customer",2024-03-02 05:57:33,1
"The interface is very bad and video viewing experience is extremely bad, there is no adjustment for brightness during video watching and the video is still looking dark even after I increase my phone brightness and also most importantly it won't support full screen, it won't occupy the screen remaining at the back of the notch selfie camera.Too many buying options additionally to the app subscription.",2024-04-13 16:46:50,1
I really did enjoy using prime video it has a lot of shows on it I really enjoy but I cannot continue to support a service that would on top of charging £95 a year for prime also charge for ad removal it is extremely disgusting and anti consumer. Amazon is one of the richest companies in the world it did not need ad revenue from already existing subscribers I can see why with non subscribers but at this point with all of the recent changes I don't see a point in continuing my subscription.,2024-04-07 23:13:16,1
"The Amazon prime video App is very easy to install and very easy to use. I have enjoyed reading and previewing movies that I think, I might be interested in. With some other Apps, I have experienced movies starting when I click the option to read information about the movie or after I watch the trailer. What sealed my decision to keep the Amazon prime video after the trial offer was the great discount that I received and I can cancel my subscription at any time.",2024-04-10 01:33:18,5
Worst experience ever. I have vi mobile subscription. I have downloaded movies. But got hanging issue. So I go to app settings and clear storage and thought I will download movie again. But this is it. When I login again in prime. They says u reached device limit. I tried deregister device from settings and login again. I tried option to talk with expert from settings (not working). And I see just like me so many people facing same problem on forum. Amazon service sucks. 0 star from me.,2024-04-22 09:20:40,1
"While the app has a lot of shows and movies, the subscription is almost useless as most of the ""free with prime"" things are sequels or prequels to things that you still have to pay for Also anything more than 12 years old should be free at least with prime because there's nowhere else to watch a lot of really old stuff Then there's the subtitles, for a lot of stuff they are auto generated and completely out of sync, it's horrible, I've tried everything to fix it and nothing has worked",2024-02-17 17:00:20,2
"Streaming stutters a lot (fine other apps), have to have rotate on, before just used to play. Have to set zoom every episode. What was free is now paid, freevee with ads you can watch without account. Ads in regular prime videos, say its for new content, so does that mean if you hadn't wasted money on citadel I wouldn't have to watch ads? Also they downgraded ad version to remobe dolby vision and atmos. No point to it any longer. Cancelled membership.",2024-02-14 21:06:24,1
"Before was 5, now 1 because of ads. And if they play the commercials at the start of each episode/movie maybe I give it 2 stars. --- (Done, thanks) I only wish 3 things: 1. use profiles, so I can have a list just for me and others for family members, like the ones in NF 2. filters to hide/flag disliked movs/series 3. Controls be at bottom not in the middle of the screen and hide more faster",2024-04-13 07:38:00,1
"Used to be good value. However, the steadily increasing price of Prime subscription and most recently adverts thrown in during viewing content!!?? On top of this, content is stale with very few new shows and films being made available. Netflix not much better but at least there's a regular flow of new content.",2024-02-10 07:04:45,1
"It was already bad enough that additional subscriptions are required for some of the catalog, but now having to pay to remove ads is so skeezy. It is not obvious you need an additional subscriptions for somethings until you try to watch it. And the app is not even as good as other streaming apps. Netflix and Disney aps are both way better.",2024-02-28 00:08:37,1
Please improve the ui it's not great because I can't watch any tv shows in full screen unless I zoom it like the boys and fallout and many shows have this issue.My samsung S23 Ultra lags while playing movies or tv shows it skips frames for a few seconds it's looks very buffery and choppy please fix that.This app has great content but the application sucks.,2024-04-18 18:35:46,2
"I have multiple streaming services. Too many of the list and definitely more than I need. That being said, in comparison with most others Prime is actually quite glitchy. All platforms! They actually need to really update their apps because it does seem to be our go-to service now that we dumped Netflix. I have several channel subscriptions within prime and use it quite a bit, but again in comparison to others they definitely need to update the app!",2024-03-26 00:02:58,3
"Subscribed but it's not showing I have used this app before but I had let my subscription expired. I have paid to reactivate it a few hours ago but until now I can't watch anything, as it tells me I need to pay to watch while I have already paid.

"This Freevee tv is just ridiculous, i watched 10 ads in one episode each minimum 1 min. If you rewind you get an ad push forward an ad, and so on till you find the spot you're looking for, its just a scam at this point. Edit. Now ""picture in picture"" isnt working properly cant pause and play. But it works with other apps.",2024-04-04 08:07:34,2
"App streams ok, which I guess is the most important thing! But I'm not happy about the ads - obviously. And whilst brief now will continue to get longer and more intrusive, like a certain streaming site where people upload their own videos - YOU know! Which is bearly watchable now. The difference being that we already pay for Prime and now they want more to go ad free. Go figure! Also the way the 'my stuff' section is poorly laid out, not intuative and clunky. Not the best experience overall.",2024-03-11 10:24:03,3
The app has become unstable over the last few days. It won't play anything much past 30 minutes and crashes frequently. Reinstalling doesn't fix it. It's always worked fine until recently. I even pay for the ad-free experience,2024-04-15 03:47:07,1
"Personally for me with the kind of entertainment i watch prime is amazing, now that the streaming catalogue has grown vastly ranging from all kinds of genres such as drama , action , thriller crime series , comedy its just as good as netflix maybe even better as it provides you with multiple different streaming services within the one app. The only negative for me is paying a full pay subscription only to be asked to pay again for services your paying for too watch in the first place #freetshir",2024-04-18 03:33:17,5
"It's trash to navigate and has unskippable ads that are far too long for a service that I pay a monthly fee for. Unless you have a reason to do most of your shopping and shipping through Prime, there is zero reason to ever bother with Prime Video. Be like Blackbeard.",2024-04-11 17:06:35,1
"I am using it on android, and it never stays fixed on full screen mode when watching a movie. Even when I press the upper right button to flip the screen, after a few seconds in portrait, it goes back to the normal screen. Only after I force stop te app, it work, but only until I select a new movie. They have a lot of great new content, but the amazon Prime vide app is the worst from any other competitors.",2024-04-13 08:02:53,1
"Dropped the score again. 80% of this app are movies and shows they don't offer....yeah, the app doesn't actually give you most of what's on it after paying. You have to pay for commercials? Way to be Google, Spamazon. The picture-in-picture function is pretty great though.",2024-04-11 00:55:33,1
"Difficult to use, frequently refreshes while you're browsing, so you lose your place. Very hard to find anything to watch. Compulsory ads (trailers) that interrupt shows, and it does the compulsory ""are you still watching"" thing constantly to the point you will absolutely give up watching and go to a different steaming app. When I'm finished watching the few decent shows it has to offer, I'll definitely be cancelling and go back to streaming options that actually let you watch your show.",2024-04-07 05:47:03,1
It has become very slow and everything is on subscription. It's better to spend money on other OTT platforms. Even the subtitles are shown with 3 seconds delays. Whole watching experience has become pathetic. Please do not waste money on prime membership for the sake of online content. They keep pushing everytime on either rental basis or on subscription basis. Never recommending this service to anyone,2024-04-21 10:32:37,1
Prime time video just like it says it tells you the prime time to watch videos and put some online some movies you don't get on some stations and other stations and get movies on them but this one has a lot of good movies and all of it they sure know what they're doing when they buy this game. 💀RSD💀PayPal try before you buy but if you buy you get a better deal and it works better and it plays better and just seems all the way back around 💯👑🔥🔥,2024-04-20 10:43:05,5
"It's a big shame that such big company don't listen to there consumers, what the point of buying subscription from you, when no one listens to the problems I am facing. So old interface laggy no brightness control, unable to pause video when in picture in picture mode. Useless information like x - ray and no option to turn it off. Tried to contact multiple times but no response from your side. This is getting seriously frustrating. Not sure get next subscription. I think you should update the UI",2024-04-19 07:19:45,1
I used to love the layout of the app. I used to be able to see only what was available with my subscriptions. now I have to sort through a million options that you want me to buy or rent or suscribe(which you can't do on the app). I have found myself going to other streaming services just because it's less of a headache.,2024-04-19 00:00:28,2
I think they want too much personal info now for me to use the service. Not only am a stuck in a paid account but now it comes with ads unless I pay more. I feel TV has come full circle from cable and satellite. It's now even more expensive for TV AND WITH TONS OF ADS. And why keep asking more my personal info if obviously you have enough of it in my billing and Amazon shopping account.,2024-03-31 04:36:35,1
"I have paid my subscription linked to my google play but I am not able to watch in my Prime Video, agents are not helpful as well. They just keep on transferring you to other agents but not helpful.

In addition, given that we are paying for subscription, ads should be removed.",2024-03-30 09:38:41,1

Previously prime choice icons had a banner across upper left. Now they don't. Harder to select prime movies amongst the options I don't want. Icons for top items being pushed are HUGE. Only two icons across. Way too much scrolling. 11/18/2022. Still terrible, using other stream services. Prime video should make it easy to watch prime videos!",2024-04-21 01:14:52,1
Good experince but considering canceling now that they are charging extra for no commercials. Ridiculous! There are other streaming services that are completely FREE and you have to watch commercials. I'd rather go there then deal with being taken advantage of as a consumer.

"Terrible. Aside from them adding adds to videos now that pop up at the beginning and middle of 20 minutes episodes, FAR too much content ""isn't available"".

It's a damn good thing I have same day shipping or I wouldn't use Amazon Prime. Edit: Just got the update that I pay for a service with advertisements now.

I would have given it a 5 but I don't agree with the commercials. In the beginning one of the main reasons for paying for prime was bec there were no commercials. Now they want more money to not get commercials! It makes me really mad! At least they're short ones. But how long before that changes also!,2024-04-12 02:22:28,4

"I hate it when you go to cast to your device then it pops up with another device connected to the account last second and makes you click on that instead, I don't know how many of my family members are annoyed at me ruining their show connecting to their TV, also the selection could be far better with the money amazon has there shouldn't be so much awful movies, their budget certainly isn't going on staff",2024-04-23 22:25:17,3
Have never had a problem before but I am trying to watch Fallout on an LG OLED tv and it is just black. Audio works but no vision at all. Something to do with Dolby Vision? Any other videos or shows I watch are fine. Just Fallout. Pretty disappointed I can't watch it.,2024-04-17 11:52:17,2
I have watched many a film on Amazon Prime for so long I cant remember when it was that I first subscribed to it. I know that it wasnt long after signing up with Netflix Its because of these two video streaming services that made me give up watching cable ad filled services. Thank you for great movikes and special series,2024-04-07 01:47:28,5

Thumbnails of a show can represent any one of the seasons in that show, and if you're not careful, you try to start a new show and end up in the middle of the series.

Horrible Amazon Prime video charges for every good movie no matter when it was made if it's a good movie they charge for they always want you to sign up for another app or free trial.

Amazon prime used to be great but then they became greedy. First music app was destroyed by turning it on to another Pandora Then they started charging delivery for some items here and there now it looks like it'll e standard to the rate they're going and lastly now ads on the garbage content they have on Amazon video. I think if at least a quarter of subscribers boycotted by cancelling account they would have a second thinking about the thing they're doing.. I'll be gone by the end of my term,2024-04-09 01:55:20,1
We have to pay additionally for a lot of contents. Still so much for a subscription!!! I don't want the prime benefits of Amazon Shopping or Amazon music. Just workout a cost for prime videos alone.

Several glitches lately. I doubt anyone likes that we have commercials for a paid subscription. The interface is now terrible It's very tough to find what you're looking for.,2024-04-11 00:53:24,1
"I'm Highly Disappointed! I've been a Prime Member since more than 5 years now! The App experience, Layout, feel and Quality has been deteriorating since the last 2 years... It's very difficult to watch content and also the content isn't so great! The worst part is any south movie that comes in regional language, the Hindi version comes literally after months! There was a time when we felt that there's no need for another App like Netflix since we have Amazon...But now it's getting worse!",2024-04-04 02:37:56,2
"OH MY GOD!!!! This app is so irritating!!!! You make us pay money for subscription and then you go and do the dumbest thing every; put the movies on rent....... Like are you broke or something???? And that's not even the worst part, when you skip the intro it only skips to half of it..... Dude we are asking the intro for a reason, it needs to skip all the way. Also why does the video play in portrait mode, it's default should be landscape. IT'S A VIDEO PLATFORM FOR GOD'S SAKE.",2024-02-19 17:01:11,1
"So this app just doesn't work anymore? I've downloaded and tried to use it and it just doesn't load. So, I deleted it, reinstalled it, and the same thing happened. So I deleted it again, waited A MONTH, and re-downloaded it. To have the same problem. Other prime video apps still work, just not on mobile for some reason. Maybe fix this?",2024-03-12 10:51:28,1
"Great content, some of it now interrupted by ads, which is a shame, but it's all down to the bottom line of the ledger. App very rarely glitches though. It would be nice if there was a more intuitive way of exiting the player or minimising the app without exiting.",2024-04-02 10:21:27,4
"I do enjoy all the variety available on Prime Video but as I was watching the show Bosch recently, 1 minute and 30 second commercials started popping up with no SKIP button that I could see. One of the reasons I use streaming apps is to avoid commercials I get on my regular cable channels. I am not happy about this at all.",2024-04-03 12:06:39,2
This was my go to app for movies and TV. Now almost everything is subscription channels or the Freevee station. And now all shows have adds. For what I pay yearly for Prime there should be no adds. This will be my last year paying for Prime. And I was really looking forward to Reacher season 3.,2024-03-31 14:42:04,1
"We already pay for a service... but it only gives you partial access to some movies or tv show. Now, there are adds every 10 minutes while watching movies and you need to pay additional fees to remove them. Besides, the ""app"" for the computer does not work well. It bugs all the time.",2024-03-01 15:45:49,1

"I initially paid $79 per year for this app and free ith a lot more content. Amazon has FORCED me to agree to higher rates up to $150/year to keep the status quo, but now it's not the status quo. Now I have to endure ads, which I have not agreed to. I'll use any of the free apps with equal to better content if I want to deal with ads. For the price, I don't agree to ads",2024-03-13 05:50:36,2

Was watching several shows on mobile with VPN switched on and out of nowhere it's saying due to geographical licensing issues shows aren't available, not just one but all I attempted to watch.

Netflix is much better in terms of UI.",2024-02-29 16:52:58,1
"We dont watch anymore and are going to cancel subscription. Ads are annoying. You are annoying us to get more money, yet we do not get more for the money. Nope. We are canceling. Same thing with Amazon music. Make us listen to horrible suggestions when we want to listen to playlist. Pay more for unlimited but we dont get more for our money. Pay more more more just for less annoyance? No.",2024-03-08 17:57:21,1
"As per my experience, this is way better than Netflix since my son and I can access it anywhere. Unlike the other one which you can only access within 1 network only. Once you decided to access it elsewhere, you surely can't. Total waste of money when you subscribed for multiple gadgets plan. Glad I tried this.",2024-04-02 23:26:39,5

Now they added ads to something that already costs over $100....with a decreasing library of videos and movies that don't require to be purchased or sub-subscription. Keep your ads on Freevee.

Content organization, content prompts, episode auto starts, finding content you've already started watching.. it goes on and on but none of it works or is laid out in any sort of sensible manor. Considering netflix set such a precedence it's amazing how this app is a dumpster fire.",2024-02-17 15:15:28,1

Dropped frames when watching movies and videos on S22. Can't be my internet connection cause I've got upto 100mbps down and 30 up.

"Really bad app and experience. Despite choosing a language in settings, trailer will use the language default by location, it shows movies that you can't watch, also restricted by location. Not to mention paying for the service only to find out you need to pay extra for some titles and no add. Baaaad",2024-03-16 20:54:08,1

Then Amazon goes and forces Ads in, when I Subscribed the service was advertised as Ad free.

At least there you didn't have to understand much and just watched the Kung fu.",2024-02-18 23:10:15,3
"Suggestions are most of the time irrelevant, when looking up for movies on other platforms they usually forget to mention that in here you still have to pay most of the time (google already does that better). On top of that the app has a major issue, using a Samsung fold 4, all my videos are playing at 5 fps~, I tried disabling material acceleration but it didn't change anything. I guess you have to constantly adjust the volume or touch the screen if you want to watch a movie. I dislike it.",2024-03-11 23:48:36,2
I'd give it more stars if there weren't so many commercials and all of the shows were free with no ads like it advertised. Paying 15 dollars a month and can't watch most of the movies on here. You have to rent them or buy them. It feels like a rip-off!,2024-04-09 23:31:00,1

"Everything is fine, but movies collectionis not satisfactory. The app is good, so is its interface, features and experience.

"Don't let Amazon bully you into paying $3 more to remove the ads. Amazon prime is taking advantage of it's loyal customers. They have split off movies that used to be included with prime, into smaller niche streaming services for an additional monthly fee.

I've never found Amazon video to be worthy of paying more money and I definitely won't pay more now that we're all getting significantly less.",2024-03-07 07:10:31,1

It's got lots of good shows,loads quick, you can download things to watch offline later like if you go camping or travel, they have cool facts you cal learn while watching the show if you turn on the setting but the adds ruin it.

Not a smooth experience. I frequently have to go search for the episode I was on after taking a break. Difficult to navigate from episode to episode. Skip intro and skip recap doesn't land you in the correct spot. Some nice shows on here but majority of shows and movies are very B-grade.,2024-03-10 12:22:12,2
Can't even connect to google nest hub. This has been raised as an issue for years and Amazon chooses to do nothing about it. App is buggy but fairly easy to use. Not all amazon exclusive content has subtitles which is a shame for those that need it.,2024-03-29 21:41:30,1

Waste of time & Money. Worst search bar I never seen 1. If I search a movie name it will show in words but ainctent will show other. We cannot get what we search in search bar. 2. 2023 released movies also we have to take rent. If we take annual subscription what is the use of it and why we have seen on rent basis and the rent which we are paying they will allow nus watch the movie only one time 3. While watching video only. If we forwarded the video we will get only audio video will freeze,2024-04-16 17:13:06,1

With recent update, you can't watch movies in landscape orientation unless you have screen rotation on, it stays in a weird portrait mode with lots of information below as default. Everyone likes to watch movies in landscape only, at least give an option to change default setting.",2024-03-16 03:37:02,1
"Way to go Amazon!!! Way to nickle and dime everyone once again! Amazon Prime Video use to be add free. TV shows and movies where at our finger tips for a set monthly price. ""Oh no!! How can we make them pay more!?"" Lets throw ads back in the mix and have them pay another fee to get rid of them. Streaming use to be entertainment without advertisements. That was the whole pitch in the beginning. Sadly, like all other companies, all they care about is affording their 3rd summer home. Cancelled 🥳",2024-02-12 03:47:11,1

It's hard to actually get stuff on certain devices as for me it sent me a link via email and it took Me to a different version of amazon were I could get shows and films and watch it on my amazon prime As for watching stuff it's pretty average very little ads is great all of the shows I've seen have english captions but I haven't seen other languages lots of great shows and movies tho I like the app very much I think it just needs a few changes to make it easier,2024-02-21 03:39:56,4

"App keeps lagging and I was watching episode 3 I paused and accepted a call and when I come back to try play episode 3 from where I left the app takes me back to episode 1. I have to close the app clear cache or reinstall everytime. Also quality settings should've had a 480p option like any other app. The interface could've been better. There should be a section where we could browse by genre, initials. Movies section should be ""separate"" in mobile version.",2024-03-20 15:07:28,2
"So let's talk about the ads. Terrible idea, awful implementation. Firstly, the ads are highly intrusive in shows that are not made for them. Extremely annoying. Secondly, the ads have caused the app to become extremely buggy, to the point where shows won't play at all, will skip to the next episode, or play ads every few minutes. Overall this platform is becoming more unwatchable by the day, and I certainly won't be paying extra for something to go ad free. No renewal for me.",2024-02-09 14:36:59,1

"Edit: I re-installed the app to watch a show, but the ads were even worse than expected. It didn't even last 30 seconds before I uninstalled. Prime Video was great when it was released, but then they decided to start charging extra for certain shows. Now, they've decided to extort additional money from their customers by forcing them to pay extra to avoid adverts. You either charge a fee or show ads, not both. As such I'll be allowing my membership to lapse and deleting the app once it expires.",2024-02-21 18:32:17,1

"Useless. Got this on my iPad and it's a nightmare watching shows. Ads play every two-three minutes, when the shows aren't designed to have ad breaks. Also, half of the time, the app gets confused after the ad, and it changes the episode we're watching. Oh and at the beginning of every episode, the show starts at the end, I then manually have to set the episode to start from the beginning. Worst user experience I could have asked for. Fml never paying for prime again if I can avoid it.",2024-02-06 13:19:21,1

"First of all, Amazon badly needs to invest in a redesign of all their apps, because the usability and placement of everything in them is overall bad. But what I hate the most, is how you can PAY for a prime subscription, and STILL have ads, sill have shows and movies you have to buy/rent separately, AND there are others locked saying ""free trail"". Like I'm literally logged into an active subscription, and there's still no way to watch certain things..... WHAT?",2024-03-18 12:34:28,1
"The app does not tell you when new episodes in your watchlist are available or when new episodes of a show are online at all. The ""recently added"" only refers to brand new shows, not eps. They have subscriptions of channels but you can't see what shows are on there before your subscribe. If you're on here for TV shows, the app is nowhere near as functional as Netflix, etc",2024-03-23 12:54:55,3
"Pay to use, then pay to use. It's frustrating to be bombarded with shows on the home panel that you are expected to pay more to access, on top of the subscription you've already paid.

Can't even rewatch the first episode (so it's not like just one episode was free or that I accidentally purchased an episode). Never encountered anything like this before and is so infuriating. Especially when I'm paying for add ons to the app already.",2024-04-02 05:03:43,1

Shows and films produced by the platform do not come across as politically motivated as with many other streaming platforms nowadays. However, suddenly there are ads.

Are executive bonuses really getting so out of control that making $3 billion a month off subscriptions ($12.99*230 million subscribers) isn't enough anymore?

They only give you 5 seasons but say its the complete series when it's 10 seasons,2024-03-14 17:10:27,2
It's slow. It can't keep track of the shows I've watched correctly. When watching a series it often skips to the next episode in the middle of the current episode.

"Well, i love the app just annoyed that because I'm in Canada I can only get certain shows/movies. Why bother having it if I'm only allowed certain movies, tv shows, etc. Plus if I wanna watch(binge a show) I'm only allowed certain seasons.",2024-03-28 23:23:26,1
I really like my new APV subscription. The set-up is easy and info. on scenes/ actors/actresses is cool. The option to purchase/rent a relatively new 🎥 from a different service is way ok,2024-04-21 23:54:14,5

"So this is what happened, I was watching a movie and decided to continue it the next day and when I tried to play, it was up for rent and couldn't be watched for free. What is the Fing point of paying for a subscription, when they start putting up movies on rent just because a new sequel has been released a couple days ago. This is complete BS and I don't know what kind of business you're getting out of it thinking people are going to rent those. It's a stupid app and should be closed.",2024-04-03 12:17:06,1

works every time on S8 . Quickly gets to everything I need. I wish there was a way to edit the available selections. I hate those mini series. I am only interested in movies and football.

Have other ott service and prime is the worst i have. I don't think I have any benefit of having prime membership when it comes to ott....... most of content is rented or have to buy other subscription. what's the benefit of having prime membership if I have to pay extra everytime to watch on prime.

would like to give 5 stars but the ads are a little ridiculous. if you try to find where you left off you have to watch 30 sec video each time. bit much. overall a nice app. easy to use and navigate. maybe let up on the ads. not like Amazon needs the revenue from them.,2024-02-11 06:23:13,4
Easy to navigate. Addition of ads dropped score significantly. As much as I pay for a yearly subscription to Amazon I don't believe it is in customers interest to have to pay an additional fee for ad free.,2024-03-24 16:02:54,3
"Why do we suddenly have ads? We already pay for this service. Is the service going to be free now that there are ads? Disappointing and annoying. There are much better streaming services. I enjoyed the ad free experience included with my prime subscription, and the occasional ""Amazon Original"" was okay. But I won't pay extra for this streaming service.",2024-02-21 14:39:03,1
Really frustrated with the prime player. It even doesn't play the downloaded movie. Always get stucks in between amd doesn't play furthee and then you have to start over to play again. It keep doing this and doesn't let to complete the movie. Totally wasted app.,2024-02-12 09:39:12,1
"Paying for prime already, but it is not enough, so still need to pay for ""add free"" to actually enjoy watching whatever here. In the future, when everyone goes add free, they'll do something like ""promotion free"" (not add - promotions) stuff as it is still not enough money. What is the point paying for prime if it's not privileged service any longer? Deleted/unsubscribed! Hope people are smart enough to leave this service, which will force them to think more about customer experience, not money.",2024-02-08 14:39:48,1
"Very very poor selection and most options have to be bought or rented. Downloading to watch without Internet doesn't always work. Pausing and restarting a movie or show seldom works , meaning it takes too long for the show to start playing again.",2024-02-10 14:33:09,1
"Not sure if I'm just spoiled with Netflix over the years but most of the stuff on here is just garbage. Having to get a subscription inside a subscription for some content ?? Option to rent it buy a movie when you can watch it elsewhere for free... no thanks. Amazon ""Specials"" are nothing special.",2024-02-19 00:20:40,1
"I get to watch all my favorite movies and shows for free and even download my favorite and I download things I don't need. I can watch it while playing games as I usually need background sound and I get to watch a show that is only on prime video currently. It's easy to navigate and an amazing service with lots of options for people who aren't subscribed. Love the app, would recommend.",2024-03-20 02:08:05,5
"This app sucks. A tiny bump on the screen will stop the vid then won't take you to where you left off, but take you back to the beginning. Half the time you can't even play next episode because of weird formatting. I'd absolutely cancel my subs if I could find my shows elsewhere. ,10/10 would not recommend.",2024-03-08 14:33:27,1
"There is one show I have been watching since signing up for Prime. Every once in awhile, the screen goes black. I found if I back-out of the program and go back in...it fixes the problem after a few tries. This is not convenient. Unsure if the issue is Prime or my device.",2024-02-24 00:06:08,4
"The app works decently. Sometimes, it's hard to find something I want to watch, especially without having to purchase another membership/subscription. There are limited features allowing us to filter movies. I'd like to refine movies down in my watchlist, as well as what is free to me, but currently, that isn't an option.",2024-02-10 22:50:49,4
All of the good shows are an additional channel you have to pay extra for. And now they have started showing the trashiest ads ever. Ugh. I don't pay for a streaming service to get ads interrupting my movie. That's what cable is for. Bad move prime.,2024-02-23 01:18:36,1
"The casting feature should be improved, often it had given problems linking with other google and amazon devices. The free access library, in particolar for TV series could be increased under various point of view. I'm gonna say that altought that problems it is a good designed streaming service.",2024-03-06 23:32:36,2
I would have rated it a 5 star except for the ridiculous ads now. I pay for the service and have been a customer for years and now they make us pay more to be ad free. This is why I dropped other pay to watch services. So much for customer loyalty. Some people are on a budget. If I wanted ads I would have stuck with cable television. Thanks for jerking us around all for profit. Keep treating your loyal customers like this and eventually you won't have any.,2024-03-11 20:47:24,3
"It is very disappointing that you aren't provide the playback speed increase option in the application, you are so far in the field of OTT platform but still you don't realise that this feature is pretty essential. Please add this feature in application, otherwise it is very annoying to provide that much extra time to all the content. It is your responsibility to modify your policy and features as per the end user's convenience. Please take this as a serious problem and solve it ASAP.",2024-02-28 14:49:45,2
"I like the content in prime video, but the UI is consistently terrible. It's hard to get to the episode view, subtitles lag when watching foreign content, and often times when hitting continue watching the system is just not smart enough to figure out where you were in the show.",2024-02-23 13:10:50,1
The service used to be great. Since they added all the ads I can't get the service to open anything 90% of the time. It doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or using my data. It's ridiculous. Why am I paying for a service I can't use??? I don't think I'll be keeping Prime Video. There are tons of other streaming services that actually work.,2024-03-04 23:34:31,1
"The app itself works okay, but they keep making more and more features pay to use. Prime used to cover fast shipping. Prime used to cover ads. Prime used to cover a good bit of media/items. Now, Prime only covers access to those things and then you pay extra to use them. Like Sam's Club or Costco.",2024-02-10 21:47:04,3
"Lots of content. I can always find something to watch or binge. I would prefer, however, that they only displayed content that is included with prime and free to me. Showing me content that requires a subscription to some other service, is somewhat annoying.",2024-03-21 18:00:48,4
App runs well on Android. The issue I have is the limited amount of content or the quality of the content. The purchase or rental cost of content is at a premium. I really can't complain though because it's an ancillary service to my prime subscription.,2024-02-25 19:10:55,3
"I have a subscription, great viewing, 5 stars. However, it drains my mobiles battery & prevents the screen from shutting off as per my mobile settings of 1 minute. I cannot find in Pime Video any settings to power off the screen or to set to automatically work with my phone settings.",2024-03-23 11:43:21,2
Love the shows on the app but it's gone down hill since they added ads for PAYING members. They want an extra 3$ a month to skip the ads. I don't think if I'm paying for a service that isn't TV that I would get TV experience. Were being milked for extra money just to escape ads once more. Shame.,2024-02-17 13:14:54,3
"I'm not on social media, so I may have missed the news that you were beginning to add advertisements to our (already paying) Amazon/Prime services (unsolicitedly). So I hope you accept this unsolicited advice: If you're going to make us watch these ads anyway, please put them ALL at the beginning of the screening so you don't interrupt our viewing experience otherwise. Kind of like the commercials we've been forced to watch at movie theatres before every dang movie for the past 15 years. Thanks!",2024-03-25 20:30:35,3
"the reason why I got the subscription originally was to access series and watch them for an affordable price. Now they have dtarted showing commercials IN THE VIDEOS (ca. 30 secs and unskippable) and I am PISSED. Thinking about watching my series somehwere else because this is laughable. Raising prices and then also adding ads? Are you serious?? What even for? There were no additional services that justify these terrible changes. This sucks, it's terrible!!",2024-02-27 03:28:28,1
"I can't use my Bluetooth to pause video. If I close the app after finishing an episode and go back later, the app asks me if I want to watch it again instead of going to the next episode. Not enough free to watch movies. If I'm paying for prime, why do I have to rent or buy to watch it, especially if I have to watch bad commercials now?",2024-02-12 23:53:42,3
"Why am I paying a monthly fee to watch this and then have to pay to not have ads? If I'm paying a monthly fee, there should be no ads. So is prime video going to be free to use now, now that it's shoving ads at us? Get with the times. Double charging is right messed up. Really thinking of discontinuing my subscription to this... make it free if you want ads...",2024-02-24 18:33:44,1
"I pay the extra money to not have ads, but every episode starts with ads. If I don't finish an episode, the option to resume from where I left off is gone. I have to start over from the beginning. Unacceptable for what the amount we pay for services!",2024-02-16 00:35:47,2
"Great app, huge library. Between prime gaming and, prime deliveries and prime video the prime subscription absolutely demolishes all of the other options available, I can't believe people still give money to Netflix after their password sharing disaster and ever increasing prices for ever decreasing full series. Prime works great on Android phone, Android TV, Microsoft PC; wherever you want it and they don't charge you more to watch in full resolution like the other money grubbers either.",2024-02-15 19:25:28,5
"This is application is going worst each day. Even after taking subscription, some of the movies which were available for free are now being kept in rent. Not sure what is the point of taking yearly subscription. Each day @Amazon is adding good movies (which were free on subscription) are now being added in rent. Really very disappointed.",2024-03-17 14:18:42,1
"This app is amazing! Even with the commercial option, the commercials are usually no longer than about 20 seconds as opposed to other apps where it can be as long as 1-2 minutes long. Also, the commercials are only at the beginning of the content, not throughout.",2024-02-10 21:34:26,5
"Between now having ads and your sub par customer service, I'm seriously considering cancelling my service altogether. It's bad enough that I pay almost $20/month just for prime video but now I can't even get packages delivered when you say they'll be delivered and, because they've already been shipped, I can't even cancel the damn order.",2024-02-26 20:40:08,1
"Quality is good and has some real good series and films. My problem is I downloaded a series successfully but once I had finished with it, I deleted it and attempted to download the next series. I was hit with a notification saying I'd reached the max and need to delete others which as mentioned I already had done. I waited for renewal and attempted again only to get the same message again. How can I be at max when I deleted a whole series for more?",2024-03-23 02:09:17,3

Worst app ever!!! 😡 Customer service is the worst too! never had a bad experience with Netflix for many years! But this one OTP doesn't go through my phone nor to my email. I cannot login anymore but they are still charging my card. the worst is they cannot cancel my subscription on their end!,2024-03-11 20:13:34,1
"Prime video is the only steaming app to use. They come with free shipping on shopping and it's all $10.49. Great shows and good app. The designer was a good one. I cancelled all of my other streaming services because they all suck and charge too much. When I run out of content, I read a book and go back after a week or 2...depending on the book.",2024-02-23 01:50:42,5
Most of the time it doesn't connect with my TV. I've tried everything and only once in a blue moon it works on my TV. I can't watch it on Mt phone it hurts my eyes. So that means I've only been able to watch a few movies and I've had prime for more then 6+ years.,2024-02-12 11:35:24,2
Too many glitches. I sign out and uninstall then reinstall and sign back in and the home screen works and all pages work with movie selections except when I press play on any movie all I get a is black screen with sound. Going to have to cancel unfortunately since support can't help with the issue.,2024-02-25 06:16:18,1
Of course the app is great for watching things on the go. But I'm disappointed in the amount of ads I'm watching per show. I get no discount for the added ads but have to pay extra if I don't want them anymore. Disappointing.,2024-02-27 17:10:29,3
"Dear Amazon Prime, your content is too good. But since viewer can't increase playback speed, content took too long and become boring. All your competitors have introduced feature to increase playback speed. Please introduce it soon. I have a long watch list but imagining them viewing at 1x make me reluctant to watch them. Hope you'll take cognizance of this genuine problem of viewers. Best Wishes.",2024-03-21 06:00:35,2
It's a decent app - despite adding in ads now.... But lately I'm having issues with it lagging. Like it drops down to 30 frames per second. It plays one episode fine and have to reset it to fix that. Now having issues with it freezing and not loading at all.,2024-03-21 20:23:58,3

This app has a lot of bugs. Too messed up to sign in on mobile and also on Smart tv. I already has an account but I don't really know what's wrong signing up on TV. I've been trying to sign in on TV but can't make it through. Even I already input code for a lot of times.,2024-02-15 17:54:54,1
Can't seem to store alot of content in downloads! And I've tried using both internal storage as well as external storage! I've different brand SD card plus I've tried different devices. The fact is that I can only store a few episodes or a few movies on this app very disappointing,2024-02-09 14:13:55,2
"On full 5g or wifi it takes forever to load a play shows or movies. Ads will sometimes glitch and play in your show and it will count it as the show time and you miss half the episode. If you load the show after closing after finishing an ad, it will give you twice as long enough of a time before and only play the show for 15seconds before playing another ad. When it does work (when it wants to) everything's fine hence the 2 stars and not one.",2024-03-16 14:08:34,2
"Rent a movie option is not good, we pay and buy a subscription but then we again have to pay rent for some movies which is not so cool. Netflix and other OTT apps are far more better than this.

Not good movies are there . I don't like it. Better is that to bring all those series and movies which netflix have because they have very realistic features of watching movie the best action movies and the best horror movies .

"One star and will not be changed unless two conditions are met. Prime video forces the user to sign out of the Amazon shopping app. This is terrible for several reasons. One can't exactly use the same prime membership account to gift who their married to if both people use that account, so to force me to log out of my shopper account just to watch videos is unacceptable. After finally setting up the app, it won't stop loading on the Who's Watching screen to change to my profile.",2024-03-14 10:44:52,1

When I subscribed to amazon prime it was for watching videos AD FREE as it stated. What's the point in paying for something when there are adverts? The company gets both our money and the money from the adverts too. I think that's too much. Its not cheap either.,2024-02-21 20:58:08,1
"I cancelled my prime subscription. Prime is much more expensive than ebay plus and now since prime video has been removed there is not much of a benefit over ebay plus left.

We take subscription so that we don't have to see Ads. But now it's showing ads like other apps . Amazon Prime is disappointing their customers. Nowadays it's becoming like television. In 2 hours of movie you get to see 10 Advertisement.. what's the point to then purchasing the Prime. Starting ad was fine but they're now adding ADVERTISEMENT in 15 to 20 minutes in a 2 hour movie,2024-02-28 10:01:42,1
There are issues with things pulling up easily and sometimes the sound is off. I could put up with it but also don't appreciate Amazon breaking contract and adding in commercials unless you pay more. Greedy and under handed of them. If it didn't come with my Prime membership I'd cancel it just on principles.,2024-02-21 17:01:31,2
"Sincerely, Amazon Prime Video has been a game-changer for streaming services because of its commitments to quality and excellence. The library has MANY movies, TV shows, AND original content for every demographic, lifestyle, & preference. The app is user-friendly, which almost seamlessly ensures that I can easily find my current binge series, trusty fave, or new fave. Being able to download content is also helpful. The algorithm isn't flawless but is very intuitive. I really enjoy using the app.",2024-03-17 18:07:37,5

Mandatory ads are inserted into the worst possible times in the show. I'm watching a show that originally aired on cable so it has places for commercial breaks but the app puts adds in the middle of a scene. I would give 0 stars if I could.

"It's unbelievable that in a premium streaming service they added ads. It's like watching TV in 90's. 1 star, nothing more, and unsubscribing. Also, it does not always store the last watched episode, or randomly starts from the next season. Sorry to be harsh on the devs, but this is pure trash.",2024-03-16 22:42:11,1
"Surely the app has design and navigation issues, but video interface, video resources, language and subtitle menus etc. are better than almost all other streaming apps. I subscribe to at least two channels, instead of subscribing directly with the provider, because of these features and I'm sure they will keep improving.",2024-03-14 17:20:54,4
"This is probably the worst of all the streaming options out there in the market, almost all the good movies and series require an extra add on. This completely defeats the purpose of having a membership if you have to rent all the good movies at the end of the day",2024-03-03 09:01:19,1
I loved it but it keeps going out on the screen each time I press the 10+ seconds button but other then that it's really good and nice quality but the fact that you need to pay extra for other movies is crazy you put them on there saying oh u need to pay more don't even bother putting it on the app,2024-02-19 01:51:34,3
"We used to love Prime, but now that they've started showing ads, they cut off the end of the movie or TV episode! One movie we were watching, they stopped it when there were still 20 minutes left!

"What's up with the ads?? Seriously?? We already pay a lot for this service and now this garbage? Time to start looking for other options.

Amazon video has had a real fall from grace. I used to love Amazon video but now it's just an advertising board for other movies and streaming services you have to pay extra for on top of your prime membership. Some shows even have ads in them. It's so sad to see that amazon didn't hold their head up and lead the way when other streaming services are following the hidden cost/advertising bandwagon like sheep. After years of membership I end mine today. Sad times.,2024-02-18 09:29:00,1
The app is... Functional. What's with needing to subscribe when I have a subscription? Netflix did more for just $15/month. (update and now Prime does ads with apaid membrship...) Sorting by seasons is odd. To discover a new show you can save the show at a season only unless you actively seek the season you need. Why not let me save the show and remember the season I pick and have watched? I only see a resume feature on my PS4. The app can have issues locating the TV it's already or was recentl,2024-03-19 02:40:52,3
"First of all, for a paid service, the number of ads is unforgivable. The bugs are an issue too. If the audio or subtitles for your language are unavailable, it will bombard you with tabs at the bottom of the screen which you can't get rid of. Poor service",2024-03-24 20:57:32,1
"How to go from the best streaming service to the worst? Randomly put ads in, when your customer already paid for an entire year of what was supposed to be no ads. To top it off...heaven forbid you accidentally touch your phone, skip forward. Just did that. Picked up my phone while watching a movie, because I was going to sit somewhere else. Accidentally skipped toward the end. ""Watch a few minutes of ads now!"" Go back to your spot? ""A few more minutes of ads!"" Will never sub again.",2024-03-18 22:29:29,1
Out of all the streaming apps this is by far the worst horrible app same as your tv app. The design is poor navigating it is even worse. A resign of the app and look is needed.

even after payment there are ads in shows and after paying subscription amount for prime videos they're are many good movies and shows Which are on rent and If we want to watch those movies we have to pay extra money on monthly basis.

I love the app for the most part. I hate that I have Prime I pay for Prime and yet they still want me to pay for more Prime movies that they have on their I think that's ridiculous these are older movies so why would I have to pay for them but the new stuff that's coming out I can watch it because I have the prime app it makes no sense to me. that's my only real complained about it otherwise I like the addition of adding different other streaming sites to it so it's all in one app,2024-02-16 23:16:51,4

"Despite having an annual subscription of the app every movie is titled to some add-on subscriptions, then why there is a need to be a prime subscriber of the app. Amazon Music lacks features and is worst compared to the likes of Spotify and YT Music, Jio Cinema and Netflix have way better titles than Prime Videos and they don't ask for extra charge and I don't find having a prime subscription for faster delivery as in many cases it still takes 2-3 days similar to normal delivery cases. Worst App",2024-03-10 17:37:17,1

Loved prime video up until a year or so ago when they started having movies you had to subscribe to other accounts to watch. Why offer it as an option then?? And then the recent addition of the ads happened...what was left of my opinion of Amazon sank even lower. 2 ads in the front and now 1 more in the middle of a 25 minute episode. Are you kidding me??,2024-02-15 07:32:01,1

"It's gradually getting worse. It was already annoying that you browse by category, and they throw in stuff you have to pay extra to watch. Then they add adverts, so despite still paying my membership I have to have obnoxious marketing in the middle of my show. Really nice when a suspenseful moment is interrupted by a 25 second advert for pepa pig. They also don't put out a lot of good original content at this point. Value of the subscription is diminishing.",2024-03-02 01:50:44,2

Ads - the scurge of the digital age. We used to pay a subscription and get no ads. Great. Now you have to pay more to get no ads. Why do we accept this? We have become assets to be advertised at. Awful experience. Music is now useless. Video annoying. Delivery is the only perk. Not worth it.,2024-02-26 12:12:54,2
So many poor design features with the app. One example is the passcode entry boxes when you get something wrong and need to delete. Additionally is it prompting you to put a code in for every single episode even though you authenticated already on the previous video.,2024-03-13 04:08:26,2
"Unnecessary ads, ridiculous. The player lags more than half the time on a s24 ultra this company is just laughable. I even need to restart the app multiple times until i can get a proper playback without frame drops and stutters. And if thats not enough, they started botting their own reviews, which where written after they implemented commercial ads not only in front of playback but even during said playback. No one would go write a five star review after this change... But judge for yourselves",2024-02-27 17:50:10,1
Now this app is charging for everything. How is it fair we are paying for subscription and still we have to rent for movies. Earlier I use to like this app not anymore it's just waste of money paying twice just to enjoy your favourite shows. Changing my review. And I believe it's really bad to charge like this it's really not fair.,2024-03-26 06:39:48,1
"The Paramount+ content is poorly supported, particularly for FA Cup content. If a game has ceased live broadcast, it' too difficult to locate a recently played/ended game. Also, the delay in the completed games appearing in the episode list is excessive. These should be available to view once live broadcast has completed. I'm still waiting for a game to appear 7 hours after the game finished. Avoiding media to not see the result is a pain.",2024-03-17 02:31:31,2

Commercials for 140.00 a year? Corporate greed knows no bounds. I called about this and was told it was some type of trial and I wouldnt be affected but now have several minutes worth of commercials before watching anything. I have to discuss with the family but I think after more than a decade of being a prime member I will be canceling. It a shame.

I deleted this app because I was angry about now being charged a fee to watch without ads. Even then I rarely used it because I found the menu to be less streamlined than anyone else's. I'll finally delete it again when next January comes because that is renewal time. I won't be renewing my Amazon Prime ever again.,2024-03-05 19:26:27,1
Well not only are once free shows now stuffed with ads. With an non intuitive way to scrub through the video. The ad free version still plays ads. Pretty frustrating that even with the raising of the prime membership greed still has them pushing for more,2024-02-18 05:11:56,2
This is for the decision to start including ads in a subscription service. Going to have to do some sums and see if the membership is still worth it for free delivery. If it isn't I'll drop this service. Amazon won't care how unhappy its customers are as long as they pay.,2024-03-18 18:47:49,1
"this isn't just about the mobile app, it's about the ads on all platforms. I can't believe this multi billion dollar company with millions of active subscriptions worldwide needs to implement ads on a service we already pay for.

A few Amazon originals and exclusives that anyone can pirate with a Google search?? Smh..",2024-02-12 23:43:13,1
Instead of telling your customers you are raising your rates you give us Commercials and then give us the options to pay $3 no $2.99 additional charge to stay commercial free! Now Number 1. Because someone charged something I did not authorize on my debit card I was unable to up grade 2. Because of the Incompetence of chase bank sending my debit card to an address I have not used in two years I am stuck watching commercials Something I could do for free just by tuning in to channel 7 Chicago,2024-02-18 23:18:03,1

Try to include more languages. I do understand Italian but french movies should be in French and English movies should be in English. It's not even translated correctly.

"App is great, but it just a shame that despite if you pay for prime, you still get adverts and you still have to pay for certain films. --EDIT-- amazon now deliberately added adverts so that you can pay extra to get rid of it",2024-03-19 12:17:13,3
There are some good original shows like the boys and invincible. There is also freevee which has a lot of good movies. There are not that many good things to watch otherwise. Which is fine since you prime Shipping.,2024-03-20 15:21:39,3
What a messy and non user friendly interface. So buggy. So many steps to watch a show on your phone and then so hard to exit out of it. I press continue watching and it plays from the start every time...,2024-03-01 11:01:26,1
It starting putting ads during the videos and then expects me to pay more to get rid of them. I don't pay $140 a year for ads if there was a way to separate Prime Video from Prime itself I'd cancel the subscription.,2024-02-22 01:47:38,1
"Addition of ads (unskippable or not) on Prime content is a downgrade When you pause a show and your phone screensaver turns on/phone turns the screen off, instead of just showing the video as paused the app goes back to your show listing and have to tell it to resume the video",2024-03-08 21:52:22,2

When watching downloaded movies. Sound cuts fades in and out at times. Audio is also tinny. Even downloaded at highest quality. Only amazon video has this problem. No other streaming app.,2024-03-07 20:13:28,2
I pay about $50 a month for all the subscriptions that i have on this app and they are still forcing ads down my throat. Amazon is a 1.83 trillion dollar company and they now want 15 dollars more every month or we get ad spammed.

"Tip: if you pay annually and want to unsubscribe because of the adverts, you will get a pro rata refund. The cost of Prime went up not that long ago and now the thieving gits want to gouge more money out of us by making us pay extra to avoid adverts. And they sneakily dropped Dolby Vision and Atmos at the same time for the 'normal' tier without telling anyone. Yep, you now need to pay the extra amount for it.

Shows/Movies either have been removed or are for rent ! It's more or less a app which is trying to sell you more subscriptions. A marketplace where we can purchase other subscriptions. This app made me realise that Netlfix is worth every penny.,2024-02-25 09:55:24,1

"The app either won't play the video I bought, or it glitches and goes back to the main menu or it just shuts down completely on me! It's been like this for 2 days and I've tried everything to fix it! I hope Amazon sees this cuz this is getting ridiculous!",2024-04-22 23:22:41,5
"For a company that I imagine makes millions charging customers for its 'prime' service, the app is unresponsive, slow, glitchy, audio is out of sync, rare for it to work first time, even running the app through a fire stick you would think it would work better. Now much of the subscription included content is buried behind all the additional stuff they want you to pay extra for. For the amount you pay you get very little included in your subscription.",2024-01-09 20:02:51,1
"The app was completely unusable for a while but they have addressed that. The UI is still well below what other streaming services offer, both in responsiveness and ease of use. I tried to report some errors but customer service is obviously not where the money's going either. It all feels terribly amateurish. I'm paying for this service and yet I get trailers for random movies every time I try to watch something and I cannot disable that ""feature"". That's not putting the customer first.",2023-12-07 12:41:46,2
"For a paid subscription, you sure play a lot of ads between episodes. It's insulting. Also the 'xray' feature is annoying but there is no way to remove it. And any time I want to play a video on my phone, i have to click on a button to change the screen orientation. Every other streaming app plays the video automatically in horizontal mode. Why doesn't yours? Honestly I find this to be the worst streaming app out there. The content isn't even good. And alot of the good movies have extra fees...",2023-11-09 17:00:45,2
Nice app . The main reason is that you can split this app and also do other work at same time you can open pdfs an all stuffs . In some apps not allowed to split. But prime video liked it.,2024-04-10 03:54:15,5
Won't let you watch anything if something is downloading. I felt like I was going crazy trying to get this garbage app to run anything. The audacity to charge money for ad free when your app doesn't even function in the first place,2024-04-11 03:18:18,1

"It's called commercials. Absolutely ridiculous. Tempted to cancel. If your going to do them, do them at the beginning. Doing them in the middle is like watching cable TV all over again. Your going backwards Prime.",2024-04-14 03:07:49,2

Terrible. Always buffering and implementing forced advertisements no matter the tier of your prime subscription. Has added pricing for different shows while still requiring prime membership.,2024-04-22 21:54:06,1
We pay for all these different streaming services and you still have to pay extra for programs on a streaming platform you already pay. It's too expensive and not worth the money!!!!!!,2024-04-12 20:24:17,1
"The app works fine, yet not great. And I'm thoroughly disappointed in Amazon introducing ads to Prime. Why exactly did we stop paying for cable if our streaming services are just going to do the same thing?",2024-04-11 22:50:00,2

Worst experience. Every movie that I wann watch is either on rent or I have to go for an another subscription. Netflix is better atleast we have the access to all content in the app,2024-04-23 05:17:04,1
Now it has ads?! There are putting ads in the start and through the show that are unskipabble. Why? Don't we pay a subscription to avoid this? Outrageous. Isn't Amazon one of the richest companies in the world? Why would they want to scare customers away by doing this.,2024-04-11 20:34:34,1

Even more adds! What criminalsbto mdke you pay more gof what you already had! I'm going to dump prime ig they continue! Too many clicks to get to my watch list. And the app adds stuff to my watch list without my permission! Adds all the time! :-( At least it doesn't crash!,2024-04-18 22:39:34,1
"The app streams fine, but I don't understand why the developers can't figure out what my devices' aspect ratio is and stop letterboxing everything. Use the whole screen, please!",2024-04-12 23:48:12,3

"Brilliant...user interface is smooth. Never buffer or hang, kudos to the team. Try to add more content regularly esp. Sci-fi, thrillers etc.",2024-04-11 15:13:52,5
"The content is just not to get excited about it. Either it's to complete a storyline from other cult classics like Picard or obscure unwanted shows or movies. Because of the writers' strike, there has been very little new on any of the streamers.",2024-04-21 03:10:23,3

This is probably the worst app. You can't find shows in English. You have to open up each movie and look at the languages to determine if it's in English. You need to be able to search categories for movies in English,2024-04-07 00:13:44,1

Was a good PAID for app u til you added commercials... If you are going to do that you should be providing a free service for all such as Tubi. An app I spend way more time using since you did this. I will be cancelling prime at the end of my year. What a waste!,2024-04-12 18:24:08,1

It doesn't work most of the time. The free content and the ads make it almost worth using it. The only reason why I have it is for the shipping service when I order merchandize.,2024-04-17 05:09:00,2
"Why all the ads in the app, in paying for a service not to watch ads of services I have to pay. It would be nice to have the option to add this services, but it feels like paying Prime is useless, just a way of losing money.",2024-04-07 00:31:11,1

For prime you are taking expensive subscription and then you are uploading the movies for rent. What's the point of taking prime subscription if after subscription again need to purchase the movies? Very bad experience.,2024-04-16 12:42:03,1

Speaking only of the ui: is clunky and doesn't work as well as Netflix. Quite a few glitches that they really should have fixed by now. Plus they have added ads so that sucks.,2024-04-05 06:14:19,2
Made an account signed up for free trial with my card before i could watch anything we have locked your account due to suspicious activity........ oh ok i will sort this out quickly so i can watch something..... nope have to ring up and it connects to someone driving so you can barely hear them.... yeah nah i think i will wait a few days then block amazon on that card,2024-04-04 08:21:10,1

"It's very funny when love one says rate me. Technically this app is too good, but content wise showcasing very unorganised and clumsy, it's my opinion. Not rating. Developing must know the process of blossoming a Lotus. The app should be ventilated like that way for every users. First look and feel, Second decoratively organised and third user's behavioural suggestive page through data analytics team. I am with developer team, well maintained, but not with content and management team.",2024-03-24 11:29:57,5

What is the point of taking yearly subscription if @amazon keeps most of the movies in rent. I don't this is worth taking while Netflix and other platforms are providing very good service at the same price and same time.,2024-03-22 09:42:20,1
Horrible since introducing the adds it makes my screen flicker intermittently when adds are not loading while playing the movies. Quite annoying and frankly speaking you've butchered what used to be a good app,2024-02-26 19:55:27,1

I don't understand what is Amazon doing with its app such a grabage maintanence sometime it keeps showing up parental controls for no reason when you reinstall it does not even load anything. If we are playing 1400 a year atleast make it worth what's the point of investing in trash like this. Just do something about it.,2024-04-08 20:37:30,1

"You pay for the streaming service, but id say 3/4 of the programs id like to watch are on channels that require EXTRA payment, then to get rid of the commercials, you have to pay even more. It all adds up way too quickly to be worth maintaining a subscription",2024-03-26 01:28:00,2
Bad service. O have had Amazon Prime for years and have always had prime video since it started. NO ADS now all of a sudden they want to charge for ad free service. A bunch of poop if you ask me.,2024-02-17 04:16:07,1
"Really good in fact excellent experience from my end, love how interactive it is, the ads are minimal and honestly easy to use interface at all times. 👍🏿",2024-04-08 19:21:11,5

"Was fine with it at first, use it frequently, but now ads? Suddenly adding them to prime for no reason. Amazon isn't running low on money anytime soon, so why bring me in ads. They're annoying and intrusive.",2024-02-11 01:49:37,2

"I don't pay for this service to look at ads in between shows that I watched before with no ads. This is ridiculous. My kids just gone have to do without prime video. Disney, Hulu, and Netflix will keep getting my money.",2024-04-07 12:54:58,1

Everything plays normally but doesn't show on screen I can do everything interact with the app find another video to watch and then that video won't show on screen it'll be playing though,2024-04-12 07:49:54,1
Annoying ads. They were even kind enough to skip whole episode right after playing an ad so I could watch even more ads back to back. Starting to question why I even pay for Prime,2024-04-04 02:06:07,1
ITS great it offers a great amount of different types of films and animation etc but their is only one problem the amount of adds that's the only problem definitely get this app guys it worth it,2024-04-09 01:31:44,5
Things I hate in this app: 1.Puts other films like an ad before each film. 2.Stream quality is automatic and it can't be changed like YouTube.(1080p becomes hd if wifi is bad) 3.Changing screen orientation with the button in the app is sometimes temporary.,2024-02-24 00:13:25,2
"Hate to admit it, but this is a good app. Fast, allows you to zoom in on super widescreen movies. I only wish the picture would ignore my camera notch.",2024-04-24 10:16:35,4
"Netflix is better I'll change my mind if you remove the ads from Amazon prime because paying an extra £2.99 for ad free Amazon prime it's already £9.99 per month. I would rather watch Netflix , BBC iPlayer and Disney plus. Remove the ads from Amazon prime video Amazon",2024-02-22 18:54:43,1
"Well it used to be a 5 when they didn't have the ads. Although they are not to intrusive, the whole point of streaming apps like this and netflix was about watch and entire series in a binge watching session and without ads. Also to point out it would be better if the ads were only shown at the start of an episode not during as it completely ruins the flow of an episode and cheapens the experience.",2024-02-09 19:26:43,3
Sick of having to tap the screen or pause then unpause because the video starts playing like it's time lapsed. Just stutters all the time,2024-04-16 10:55:50,1
"For the fact I'm paying for prime yet they want even more money to watch ""ad free"" or in other words, the service I was paying for, is selfish and money hungry. I keep wondering why I still have prime when they keep raising prices.",2024-04-18 11:37:52,1

"ONLY BECAUSE OF THE COLLECTIONS I AM GIVING IT 2 STAR. OR ELSE 1 STAR WOULD BE ENOUGH. AND THE REASON, JUST TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT NETFLIX APP. THE USER CONTROLS ARE VERY BAD IN PRIME, IN FACT ANY OTHER OTT APP IS NOT AT ALL LIKE NETFLIX. PRIME IS NOT WORTHY OF SUBSCRIBING. I GOT IT FOR FREE FROM MY AIRTEL RECHARGE. OR ELSE I WON'T SPEND A PENNY ON PRIME.",2024-03-28 15:38:14,2
"On playing next episode of any series, Amazon prime video app suddenly starts to play video in some random language other than English, Even after selecting Language as English it does not change language to English and continues to play in that same random language. Very much disappointed by performance of this app.",2024-03-10 13:12:18,1
Rent for everything. I am not sure how come they are charging me every year and still need to rent movies which are exclusive on prime. Harry Potter on rent??? Seriously??? They'll simply move the most watched movies under rental and trying to earn greedily. If you want rent then stop charging for subscription at all. It's like paying for starting a service which requires further payment. Pathetic.,2024-03-19 10:11:04,1
"After every episode, it only prompts to another series. So I have to go back to the main menu, find the ""continue watching"" section, and select my show.",2024-04-17 23:27:32,1
Hate it ever since they added the ads. I gave it a chance but just not worth watching anything. Might as well just watch Tubi or Pluto at least those apps are free and no need for a subscription. Canceling my prime membership. Just not worth it anymore,2024-03-20 18:47:50,1
"I could have easily give 5 star ratings, the app is great and easy to navigate.. The only issue is downloaded movies can't be watched of TV and casting to TV is not that easy.. fix this and 5 ⭐ straight",2024-02-15 10:08:59,3

The ad roll made this less of a appreciation for prime service and more of a cash grab to separate it to a premium service. Amazon Video was amazing for something to watch on the side but I feel myself wanting to watch it less with annoying adds,2024-03-02 21:40:16,1
"Many bugs in this app,I'm not able to watch my downloaded videos and not even able to watch series peacefully due to the bugs it automatically takes me back to home whenever I try to watch the videos please fix such bugs",2024-02-26 06:12:17,1
I really enjoy watching a lot of the things that this app offers and it makes it to where you can rent of older things that are not on freevee. In my opinion it's the Best app out there!!!,2024-04-17 10:21:56,5
"It has really good movies and series. And I love that but, why in the seven hells don't you bring them permanently? Make the contract like that. It has several Hollywood blockbusters and please stop the renting system. Jeff Bezoz has already made a lot of money and why they create seperate channels? How many more otts we have to subscribe to?",2024-03-05 16:30:38,4

"Too much now, you pay for prime video, so that you can pay for movies and TV shows, so that you can watch more advertisements... Highly irritating.",2024-04-15 07:02:41,3
"the new mode where you watch series with adverts even though you already paid for prime is going to make me cancel the subscription. this is ridiculous. I pay for the faster delivery and the adverts in the beginning of episodes was fine. but it's an ad every five minutes for at least 60+ seconds???? might as well not pay for it anymore and watch normal TV at this rate. I got Prime because I DIDN'T want to watch adds all the time, now I'm being forced to watch them on a series that was primeincl.",2023-12-05 12:45:49,1
"It's tedious watching tv shows on one device and picking it up on another at a later time. Shoot, even on the same device it will send me back to an episode anywhere from 1-3 previous. I hate auto rotate but I have to enable it if I'm watching a show on the go. Closed captions are more often out of sync than the time they are accurate. Again this is on fire stick, PS5, Android 12 & 13. Other then thise three pain points, it's great.",2023-12-07 00:53:40,3
Advertise falsly for movies accessible if you suscribe for a free trial with Paramount +. But the movies are available only on rental. Absolutely dishonest.,2024-04-19 10:08:41,1

"I was watching a show and it went away, I can watch a show from the beginning to end because the older episodes arent available and it doesn't even give me the option to upgrade or anything. No options to change your settings no clear marative to guide a person. It's just bad and I love the shows they have. Why not just do what you offer or say upgrade. Settings is important and this app has nothing",2024-01-29 06:14:10,1

I've tried to report the bug multiple times but this issue keeps happening. Another annoying thing is, I keep getting ads before my video plays even though I pay for a subscription- there is a skip button but I shouldn't need to go through ads with paid subscription. It's a shame, there's a good variety of shows.",2024-01-17 08:44:01,2

"I like the way the app allows me to know who's playing what role while still watching the movie. However, when I say for a movie category, e.g., Nollywood, it'll only show me about 7 or 8 movies, and there's much more than that on the app. I don't find it easy to locate movies I'd love to watch. Moreso, it does not seem like a sizable number of movies are added; I see the same old movies",2024-01-25 20:32:29,4

Now the app itself doesn't work properly on mac book pro. The audio in suddenly stops it's just a silent movie playing .This app is a scam. Movies have been in rent to watch section for so long . Half of the movies should be paid for to watch like the lions gate and Eros now despite paying for the usual subscription. This app is not worth what we are paying.,2024-02-26 17:11:35,1

Cons: •Having unskipable ads now despite a paid membership is disheartening. •The lack of subtitles, or the subtitles just being completely out of sync can be annoying. •Many titles are locked behind different channels you have to pay for after the one week free trial. •Service shames you if you have to cancel your subscription for whatever reason.",2023-11-17 13:54:03,3

However, I don't see why I should continue to pay a subscription to a service that has decided to charge extra in app for specific tv shows and movies. This should be included in the initial service charges not as additional payments.

Very poor compared to netflix or disney or even from youtube premium or mx player. They don't even have playback speed .

Hiding the skip button behind a bar that come up and stays for 20 sec is a disgusting practice. I've paid for your service already let me decide what I want to watch. Also the fact that when scrolling it's so hard to find shows that are included with my subscription. Remove movies I need to rent from my first page feed.

"Horrible application. If you move to a different country for whatever reason and do not speak the native language, then amazon screw you over. I live in Germany, and they offer most of their things in only German audio or subtitles, even for English movies or shows. Why would you offer only dubbed versions and not the original, and with no English subtitles. It's mind-boggling how stupid of an issue this is, and they have had it for years. Better to go to Netflix or Disney plus",2024-01-01 10:18:30,1

I'm not a big fan of the trivias that they show, plus the actors that portrayed each scene. Although, I appreciate how great the job that those working in the background must have done, to prepare them for our viewing experience. I like how easy it is to navigate around the apps.

This is infuriating and is making me seriously consider cancelling my subscription. I would like this resolved as soon as possible",2024-01-26 12:08:51,1
"I like this app, however can you guys actually improve it because it keeps lagging more than 7 times an episode. The audio with keep playing but the actual video part won't. And then sometimes both won't work at the same time. For all the money you guys have, video and audio performance seems to be right down the drain and outside the episodes is only where there is actually any good in this app. Even watching it on my laptop, on the actual website is better than this.",2024-01-26 02:36:46,2

Theres no way to control the brightness when streaming. The video is lagging but only on my app bc my laptop works fine and every other streaming service is fine. I just really hate using the app. Nice content I guess,2023-12-29 22:26:51,2
I have come across the most disgusting ott platform which is Amazon prime. I have purchased membership for the sake that I will be able to watch content without restrictions but here you have tied the new popular with with rent means subscription within subscription and the content which you are offering for free in a yearly subscription is of no variation and less relevant. Movies which you are offering for rent is already available on Jio after paying a yearly subscription.,2024-03-15 13:54:18,1

I've been a Amazon prime member for years and I'm sad to say I'm about to cancel my subscription it's way too many commercials and I'm paying you guys $15 a month to watch commercials like who do you think you are or Hulu or something this is beneath you and it's tacky and disgusting and I'm going to unsubscribe I'm paying to watch all these commercials and as the same ones over and over I hate it and you lost a loyal customer I hope you're happy with your service besides these tacky movies,2024-04-23 18:56:24,1
Uuuff not subbed in ages. But decided do a month and my word has prime video gone to s***. There's adds interrupting movies and shows constantly & there's literally nothing on there to watch for free now that's not already free elsewhere. Maybe they want go bankrupt. Playback its glitch too. What a mess,2024-04-25 04:31:54,1
Frustrating. I often have trouble finding content i am currently watching. the app is not intuitive I find myself searching for things that should be easy to find.,2024-03-18 12:08:49,2
Way too much pay per view and subscription items posted cluttering up the interface making it hard to look for the free movies you already paid for.,2024-04-20 03:31:11,2
"Very hard to find content that's ""free to me"" or included with prime. Presumably this is deliberate. Updated again: to reflect the addition of advertisements for paid subscriptions in top of the previous price hike. Worse most content is paid but if I'm going to pay for digital video why on earth would I buy it somewhere so shoddy and increasingly ensh***ified. You're much better off buying from Apple TV or Google TV.",2024-01-03 12:45:32,1

You are raking in $4.7 BILLION dollars on the fees alone. I understand making money but we want a streaming service so we don't have ads. Your greed defeats the purpose!!",2024-04-09 00:31:21,1

Does the job for the most part but sorely needs some way to format film and series selections for easy-viewing; allowing a more varied list of categories/genres so the lookup process gets cut down. Too many gems you only get to stumble upon and not be purposefully laid out according to viewer preferences or even just based on a film/TV show genre.,2023-12-11 06:34:29,5

"I haven't seen any other app that has a worser search feature. It feels like Amazon has no interest in improving this app, since it comes as a default service with prime.

This is my current review based on some things I've noticed personally in my smartphone. Recently the app is acting out of sorts. Causing the phone to reboot again and again. This happend multiple times and mostly in 2 cases. 1. When I was watching a downloaded movie/series and I paused I for a minute or 2. Suddenly the phone reboots. 2. Another one I noticed today is when I'm watching a movie online in prime if I want to turn it into landscape mode. Please fix this. It's very inconvenient.,2023-11-09 05:55:59,1

"I'm from South Africa. Thx for the free 7 days, which i used 30 seconds of, noticing all the best shows can't be watched here.

"I love the prime video exclusives, I love the PlayStation UI and I love the fire TV stick ui, my only problem with it is, that they got the UI on the mobile app so wrong,it looks so ugly and displays the wrong info at wrong spots, they even made it hard to switch to full screen! I really don't have that much of an issue with one ad per episode you watch, but knowing that prime gives you so much besides video, it's fine really, the UI is just horrible, everything else is fine.",2024-02-03 22:02:42,2
"It's a really waste of money for using this app. Those movies just keep disappearing or removed by admin. Then what's the point we are paying for? Can't watch what we want. In a few days, those were in favourite turns to unavailable. It's just useless seriously. Better don't need to pay. This prime video system should upgrade their storage and should make people happy for what we are paying instead of being removed. Try to upgrade so we can watch it anytime as we want. That's what we paid for !",2024-02-01 18:57:00,1

"Good quality shows and video, just not very easy to navigate. I feel like my watchlist should be up at the top!",2024-03-02 21:38:17,3
They started forcing ads. Paying yet still have to watch ads. Not just ads at the beginning but all through the middle as well. It honestly has made me stop using it.,2024-04-03 03:02:29,1
Have to constantly close and open the app back up because the video stops displaying midway through movies or transitioning to the next episode of a show.,2024-03-28 05:34:43,1
"Selection is very narrow! Stop suggesting movies, just because I come from a certain country. Let me decide what I want you to suggest! My video store had more movies available...10 years ago!",2024-03-12 16:43:59,3
Would have been 5 stars for shows and movies other streaming services don't have but after the incorporation of ads and unskipable show promos it makes the app annoying. I don't understand why a successful company needs a mere 3 dollars more from all of there users when they all are already paying their price with prime on the shopping app. This should have stayed ad free for free. Hope Bezo decides to fix his mistake.,2024-02-02 03:23:19,1
"Regularly bugs out and just completely, PERMANENTLY stops playing the video on the ENTIRE MEDIA LIBRARY. The only solution is to completely uninstall and reinstall the app and sometimes THAT doesn't even fix it. I'm sure this is good for download numbers but when you're one of the largest corporations on earth and own a quarter of the internet you'd think Amazon could at least make a FUNCTIONAL video player app",2023-12-23 19:21:05,1
"Posted for ad free and still got s tone of ads. No one to talk to about problem, no where to go to fix it. Don't want to watch with ads... probably going to cancel all together which is too bad caused I liked prime",2024-03-09 01:49:40,1

"Horrible, decided to get the app mainly bc I don't alway have access to my browser. Thought it would be simple bc I would just log in with my Amazon account, it kept denying it even after changing my account password on Amazon and then when I did it from the app it sent it to a number that I no longer had or ever had connected to my account, and the only way to change that is to go call customer support which I can't do. Please fix this otherwise I'll just give Amazon itself a bad review",2024-02-03 03:25:32,1
"Much programming is suitable for the whole family. Including adults. Many choices are available which are intelligent without being disgusting. A little awkward to choose seasons and episodes.

I'm often informed that I am suddenly not subscribed, then it works again for no apparent reason. Many good program choices available!!!",2024-01-26 21:01:43,4
The fact that you added commercials is down right disgusting. Also if I am paying for prime stop advertising other channels and shows I cannot access without paying more over what I am paying for.,2024-02-28 16:46:21,2

"Usable. Recently when I start up the app it just sits at a black screen. I have to close and restart a few times before it goes to the loggin screen. The interface is not very organized and is mixed in with a bunch of additional subscription add-ons. To the apps credit, the add-ons are not very deceiving that they are additional pay but a little annoying.",2023-11-22 12:36:30,3
"The app seems to be fine, since forcing ads on us and not giving your customers any benefit the service itself kind of sucks. I think dropping the membership price would be a good idea for customers who watch a lot of prime video.",2024-04-01 18:55:25,2

"I have been a subscriber to Amazon Prime since it was under ten dollars a month (I believe it was $7.99 a month then). I found my way to PRIME because I was paying entirely too much on cable. I loved the fact that I could watch uninterrupted movies at home or on the go, without being forced to sit through stupid commercials I didn't want to see itfp. I am already paying to watch without commercials; that's why I came to PRIME itfp. Aren't you rich enough already, Bezos? I'm angry. Cancelled.",2024-01-30 02:34:41,1
"App is easy to use and navigate. But lags when skipping forward or rewinding. Also should include options for playback speed control, atleast X2 option",2024-03-13 02:11:15,4
Giving subscription charges for this app is like paying rent to visit shop because again you have to pay for subscription of another app or rent in it. Netflix gives better experience because whatever is there it is already available.,2024-03-16 13:36:13,1
"I am so sick of streaming services' new trend of adding in ads. What have I been paying you for, and for how long, just for streaming services; I almost never use any other prime features, and now you're putting in ads, which is why people got rid of cable in the first place. To top it off, the rates have already been going up prior to this. Get rid of the ads!

Goodbye Amazon music that is all messed up!!! Goodbye AMAZON,2024-04-14 11:08:02,3
Introduction of advertisement spoilt the whole video watching experience. Plus recently it lags when you go back 10-20 seconds before the video plays.,2024-04-19 09:17:18,1

Why is the watch party feature removed? Giving users even more reasons to leave after taking such anti-consumer measures. Seems like hiking up prices and putting multiple subscription banners (basically ads) inside the application still didn't help the bottom line.,2024-04-05 17:58:46,1

"This application has never been user friendly. But now they just started to show ads to paying customers, I guess the era of streaming services is coming to an end",2024-04-11 12:16:16,1
It's always been average at best compared to the other services but playing ads for companies I don't actually like is ruining my experience. I'm done with Amazon,2024-04-20 07:01:24,1
Love it so easy to use across all devices and easy to buy most of what I want... and download for offline... Amazon is the most user friendly,2024-04-23 12:15:15,5
ads suck first of all. but scrubbing is the worst part. if you want to rewind like 30 seconds you have to wait a couple minutes. even on fast Internet,2024-04-10 15:03:45,1

If you want to pay for two memberships of prime and stack. Get ready for 6 ads per 20min episode 30seconds each. If you want to get rid of maybe a third (only the prime ads ) you can pay a sweet 3$. Garbage money grab. Bezos is a bald greasy dick with a endless thurst for his endless money to feed his addiction to young boys. Enjoy further supporting him with this garbage,2024-04-17 22:50:43,1
We already pay for the service to see shows without ads and now you have to pay an extra 2 dollars a month to be able to stream without unskipable ads,2024-04-11 15:58:23,1

Terrible experience. Way too many ads despite being a service you pay for. A huge joke. Netflix is 1000x better and that's saying something,2024-04-16 17:07:12,1
"Stability on Android auto for offline to be improved a lot. Lot of stutter, hangs and glitches..",2024-04-11 02:19:48,3

Wish I could give 0 rating to it. No point at all of having a subscription. You still need to remt movies. Worst!!!!!!,2024-04-19 16:37:14,1
It's a good app even when u have freevee it's the samething. But for the most part I like the app. Good movies and TV shows. Thanks,2024-04-10 21:32:10,4
"Very good app for watching movies and Web series , but nowadays, We saw RENT in inside prime. It's not good for the prime members",2024-04-16 10:29:26,5
Too many ads. If i have to watch ads Tubi has more of a variety of movies and TV shows.,2024-04-25 09:26:50,1

"At the beginning all content was available, now some content is not current available because of my location. The worst!",2024-04-08 23:50:37,1
Used to enjoy the app before the ads were forced down my throat even though I had paid for ad free streaming. This will be my last month of Prime Video,2024-04-12 13:48:34,1
Great at first subscription only! I can't even watch videos when I renewed my subscription. I just wasted money on it.,2024-04-13 04:11:36,2

I read an article saying Amazon said this was another way they would get revenue.. no 💩, and your being super greedy. I see no point in paying for Amazon Prime when I'm getting ads on it anyways. I pay 2.99 for Peacock & they have ads... THAT makes sense. Amazon? For 14.99? WITH ads? No 👎🏻 after Hazbin Hotel, I'm out. Greedy, shameless people.",2024-02-07 01:40:43,1

"Prime while it has its strengths, has far more other issues at play. WORST is 80% things advertised are Rent or Buy only, if we pay for Prime why is it so dam LIMITED, getting worse almost like their package delivery service, and shows in Portrait mode 😡, may just be the last straw unless future updates change this. Netflix & even Disney are Far better, no stuttering even at UHD and films remain longer than a month, and if I've paid for it I get to watch it.",2024-01-17 09:07:14,2
"Don't like that I click on a show to read more about it then hit the back button to resume browsing, the app often resets the shows offered rather than returning me to my starting point.",2024-03-01 20:10:04,2

They cant get subtitles right at all. One of the biggest companies in the world and they cant figure out how to make subtitles that are actually in line with what people are saying. Other than that its like any other streaming service so ykno. Fix your suhtitles,2024-02-19 13:20:19,1
Forward and backward is slow. And need off improvement of smooth functioning.,2024-04-07 16:28:50,3
Ridiculous. I pay $16 a month and now Prime Video is asking for another $2.99 to not have commercials. You should be ashamed Amazon in 2 years have gone up $10 + now another $2 99. Might have to cancel my membership.,2024-02-24 19:58:57,1
Even after buying subscription still asking for extra subscriptions for different movies. Money is not enough for Amazon Still putting multiple subscription under subscription. There is limit for greed,2024-02-10 13:49:50,1
Bate and switch when I signed up the offer said add free streaming. Now they want to charge extra for add free.,2024-04-14 16:32:16,1

"Love the content of the app! its amazing... anyways the app has some issues that i think would make it way perfect (issues that make my experience a headache sometimes) - the way tv shows are shown related to the seasons: sometimes it shows a show; actually it shows a season of the show. - the way it shows the user how much watched an episode: for example when I watch an episode fully, then the interface shows that i only watched 20 mins of it",2024-01-09 03:58:21,4
The movie screen is completely black when I go in to watch a movie rather free of bought the screen is completely black might as well cancel my subscription don't waste your time or money,2024-03-09 05:11:44,1

"The UI is easy enough to use, and having access to other subscriptions under one app is convenient. But, the video will occasionally stutter and lag even with a strong wifi connection. The app has crashed before but not often. Overall it gets the job done",2024-03-10 19:55:38,3

There's only one or two other streaming services you can't access through prime video and it's convenient to be able to control them all through one app so it's really the only streaming service we use in our house anymore,2024-04-05 19:44:47,5
This app doesn't freeze. Always opens. Plus you can use English subtitles if you need them for any language even British English!!,2024-04-05 01:02:01,5
This is too expensive of a service to have adds. They're not even short. Definitely becoming less and less worth it to pay for prime,2024-04-05 10:10:55,2
"EDIT (JAN 2024): dropped another star because Amazon now inserts ads, while still charging same amount for Prime. This company is rapidly losing all factors that used to make using their services a worthwhile experience. App is good, unless you have the parental restriction PIN selected.

Without previous notice now the app have adds I'm charged for use a service Do you want more money now? It's not a good practice I will consider to cancel my subscription for sure,2024-04-14 13:56:29,1

"The videos are great. I would have given 5 stars, but Amazon started charging more for ad-free streaming on a product we already paid for.

Please sort and I put up my rating. Edit again. If you don't fix the language and subtitles I'm cancelling my subscription. How u going to dub a English movie to Spanish?",2024-01-29 15:21:52,1
When I am skipping the video 10 seconds video is pauseing for few seconds and then playing can you fix it,2024-04-20 16:28:35,1
It's not as if you get a choice about what app to use to access service and I certainly don't understand why it's rated as #7 free streaming when it requires a monthly subscription. Not a fan of it overriding the settings I set as locked in the operating system which really makes me wonder about whether or not the permission locks in the OS are properly protecting my privacy....,2024-01-01 01:25:37,3
This streams lots of shows with good sound and camera quality! Just wish ads weren't in the middle of episodes and movies.,2024-03-23 19:16:18,4
"Sometimes buttons aren't there, sometimes they are. Sometimes it starts on a different video than it was last closed on.

"Only plays online. You have to he in airplane mode to play the music of you don't have service or underground. Typically when you download songs, they can play without connection, but this app, you still need internet to listen to music which doenst make sense to waste storage to download music that still won't play.

Since using this app..I've grown fond of it because it serves the purpose to conveniently entertain me anywhere and anytime 😁 So far so good no issues on the apps.,2024-04-24 20:47:29,5
Pretty much the worst app for video streaming. Subccription is expensive then too they show ads. Many problems in app itself does not even let you create a new profile,2024-03-26 10:40:00,1

Pls fix it",2024-01-28 07:35:25,1
Don't like the fact that after closing the app and returning I could only hear the audio on my downloads. I tried streaming a new movie because I thought something was wrong with my downloads but the exact same thing happened. You guys should really work on this or I'll have no choice but to cancel my subscription.,2024-02-07 17:57:28,1

I have not had a bad experience with Prime video except for the fact that I am on Social Security and only received my monthly payments around the 29th 30th of the month. They always turn it off or put it on hold. How can I get this fixed that I don't lose so that I do not lose my Prime video during the month,2024-02-22 21:38:01,5
"The downloads are very, very slow. While watching a series the site hangs and I have to exit and restart the episode or movie.",2024-04-02 12:39:52,3
Why doesn't your app have the option to resubscribe. I literally can't find a way to give yous money to watch a video it's really stupid. Even when I go to manage subscription there is no option to resubscribe you should make it easy for us to resubscribe,2024-02-23 01:42:37,1
Very bad experience. Subscribed the account but still cannot watch anything. The apps keeps on giving instructions to log in through website.,2024-02-11 05:52:57,1
"Oh dear I've had to drop a star Buying/renting films etc is a pain as they can't be purchased via the app, with seems to defeat the purpose of everything being in the same place. As it's the same with the Kindle Unlimited app, it just gets silly opening & closing different apps to do the same thing you used to be able to do on one. It might be easier to scrap the Prime Video & Kindle app's & just enter through my original Prime App 🤷🏼‍♀️",2023-12-09 14:37:29,3

Great app I give 3 stars because of how many movies or TV shows that you have to pay for compared to the amount of free movies and shows I wish there was a bigger selection of shows and movies to watch this is why I use Tubi more it's a 5 star app,2024-03-23 22:17:35,3

Forces you to edit notifications to not get ads. It's easy enough to get rid of them if you're familiar with Android but maybe they should have asked us for our permission.

This goes for others too like AMC channels, Paramount channels,Starz..",2023-11-25 21:00:36,5

"Experiencing a lot of bugs that makes me unable to watch the downloaded movies and tv series. I am using an Android 12 based mobile device and the reason for the bugs(loading call service error,licence call error etc..)maybe due to Your app mainly optimised for latest Android version and forgetting backdoor features for older version that may lead to crashing of app. I kindly request the Amazon team to check and give solutions to such problems.",2024-01-06 03:13:54,2

"Amazon Prime offers a robust package of benefits, from fast shipping to a vast content library. However, the app's interface feels cluttered, especially with additional subscriptions.

Nice and fast app ruined by the multiples subtiles problems mentioned (in my case all way up on the screen) it appears it does that randomly on Android devices. More options for the subtitles exact place and colors should be a must. I can't fix the subs by restarting the app or killing the app. Even deleting the app with a clean install does nothing.

Every other streaming service supports skipping with multiple taps on the right or left side of screen.,2023-11-17 02:22:51,1
I would give it 5 stars except that I can't figure out how to browse the whole collection of movies and shows. It shows titles I might like but it's not like other streaming services where everything pops up. I am using it solely on my phone through the prime video app so maybe that might be why. Other than that prime video has a good collection of movies and shows.,2024-01-02 20:46:10,4

"Extremely disappointed that ad's that are now a part of what used to be an amazing service. I am sick and tired of paying extra just to be FREE from obnoxious ads.. They claim it is to invest in more content, but that shouldn't be the viewers responsibility. That's a company's interest and decision. Amazon is powerful enough to set a higher standard, but they are proving to be as profit hungry as the rest of them.. I guess 30 billion last year was not enough.",2024-02-05 03:44:10,1
"This app DESPERATELY needs adjustable resolution. Constantly videos will lock to 144p and refuse to clear, no amount of waiting or restarting the show remedies this, it feels without purpose. On Netflix when the resolution drops you can rewind and return to the original resolution, the video will need to buffer but that's fair. Yet with prime it will never return to the higher resolution, I'd WAYYY rather wait for my show to buffer than be forced to watch some incomprehensible garble of pixels.",2024-01-25 06:33:14,1

Find a movie you like, oh, rent or buy. Or worse, find a movie you want to watch, ""start a free trial to watch this movie"" which is another BS layer on top of paying already for a streaming subscription.

Love the Prime video app! It's great that it comes free with an Amazon Prime subscription so you get a great 2 for 1 deal (or 3 if you use the music app too). It has tons of great options that are free for Prime members and sooo many more for all the hit channels like Max and AMC. Something for almost everyone.

Amazon Prime is very convenient. I love that you can use someone else's account even while away from that person and/or their home. Amazon Prime is Fast and Friendly.

It was good before they added in ads to their shows and then ransomed the content with a $2.99 scheme to remove the ads.

While trying to watch a video.. That keeps buffering.. yeah overall not great!",2023-11-17 03:12:59,2
So far an extremely annoying experience. The app is extremely slow and help options are just non-responsive. App design for settings is just horrible.

Couldn't the majority of the movie.",2023-12-04 13:05:40,3

This app was working with no issues until this morning. Movies all start in portrait with the X-Ray option. The only way to correct is to deselect xray and change the device settings each and every time. I will be using a different app to watch my purchases. Way to go Amazon!,2023-11-14 23:35:31,1
Very annoying ads. I liked to watch here because it had no ads now I'm going to Considering canceling.,2024-04-18 04:14:41,1
"This app no longer has ads on launch, so I'm updating my review. It's a good app now. Snappy and responsive. I love the X-ray feature that comes with most movies. I do, however, wish the TV apps they have for the various smart TVs would be this responsive, but at least it's fast on mobile.",2023-11-29 17:07:11,5

"Not much content and the few interesting things that exist don't support many languages. eg: Doctor House exist in German but that language is not offered by prime video. On top of that when trying to view content, even when selecting best quality and on a super fast newtork it is still super compressed ans super blocky.",2023-11-29 20:44:45,1
"Not adorable anymore. Now after screwing up the music where you can't choose your own music to download. They have the balls to put ads in the movies. Oh, but pay more for no ads.

there is a good selection of movies BUT it is very hard to find them with no search function. Also there is no way of telling which items are a series and which are feature movies. There are also no indications of the length of the items untill you actually click on them and open them.,2024-01-13 00:54:58,3
"The newest update allowing me to switch to ""free to me"" is nice but being I have to be a paying member of prime to even access the app means none of it is free!!! Finally F#$k their ads!! They don't have enough content to justify ads between every episode and everytime I open the app. 4-6 ads over and over and over etc. Ads are the reason why people got rid of cable... and now will be getting rid of prime!",2024-01-08 00:01:51,1
Prime video sucks. You pay but only get a 1/3 of what they offer. The service is horrible. Constantly lagging. My internet service is ethernet to the TV and flawless. I never have issues with NETFLIX. Really hard to watch a show or movie when it constantly pauses and lags. Up your game prime.,2023-12-10 15:14:28,1

"Amazon Prime Video's decision to introduce ads is truly disappointing. As a viewer, I simply want to immerse myself in my favorite shows without the constant interruptions that ads bring. It feels intrusive and significantly disrupts the overall viewing experience.",2024-02-02 12:32:23,1
"App crashes randomly on Chromecast and mobile devices. Navigating is clunky and Prime prioritises what it wants you to watch, not always what you want to watch or have been watching. Sometimes it crashes and skips through episodes to the next in the series. Needs improvement.",2024-01-02 10:21:36,1
"It was a great app and then they added all these other links, rent and the prime content gets lost within the app. I have stopped even opening the app unless a fins it on YouTube and then do a targeted search on the app. If the app's i tention was to reduce my screen time, they are definitely doing a great job of it",2023-12-31 02:26:20,2

Paid subscription but they started showing ads while watching movies or webseries. We paid for subscription so they we can watch without any break isn't it the idea behind buying paid subscription.

Crowded homepage, difficult to navigate, really unintuitive - and constantly tries to push you to content it wants you to watch, not help find content that's right for you.

"Prime video has always been alright at best. Very low selection of good content and now the addition of ads. Paying to go add free on an already poor streaming service is asinine. I'm not quite sure how much longer I'll be using the service, especially since i dont use my prime shipping service very often. This is quite possibly the worst and the most greedy decision made by Amazon, and i highly doubt they will see very many Prime Video members opting to go ad free.",2024-02-05 20:38:00,1
"Now they want to charge you for a ad free experience!! Guess its time to use other apps such as Pluto or Roku. At least there your not being charged twice. No fees at all. So now they want you to pay for Prime, but on top of that pay another fee to remove ads!!!! Shameful!!!!!",2024-02-05 12:32:33,1
"Paid subscription for Amazon prime was worth it when prime videos had a good selection of free viewable programs & movies. Lately the subscription is only providing free deliveries on purchases on amazon. Hardly any english movie are available without renting options, or unavailable to watch in our location. It is definately not worth paying for the prime subscription as well as paying more for renting a movie. Will definately not be renewing my membership.",2024-02-06 11:16:54,1
"Bugs I faced : 1.While watching the downloaded content skipping 10 sec forward or backward results in screen blanking for few seconds, which is ruining the experience,the main moto to download is to have seamless experience. 2.Changing language is not seamless If we change language/subtitles the landscape mode changes to portrait mode which is irritating. 3.No 1.25x,1.5x,1.75x,2x speed options.( 4.Unlike YouTube you won't get full screen it stops at punch whole camera",2024-02-03 13:57:42,2

Extremly Pathetic Collection of Movies. There are Very few movies Watchable. NONE OF THE POPULAR MOVIES we want to watch are available in spite of paying upfront. Most good movies are on rent. Amazon is fooling people N Unethical. We can't come out of the app and operate any other App/functions WITHOUT CLOSING THE PRIME VIDEO APP. TERRIBLE. Drastically Slow pace of New Addition of movies. Audio quality is not up to the Mark even with the limited choices available. REALLY REGRET SUBSCIBING.,2024-02-03 18:23:54,1
No back button. Going back resets the home screen so you can't tell where you left off when browsing. Fast forward and rewind mechanisms are poor. Too many ads on the main home screen for movies subscriptions etc... Good variety and good quality streaming visually.,2024-02-07 12:32:17,2
"Adds added when I already paid for a yearly prime subscription made me cancel. I'm waiting for my year to be up. Your app kept spam asking for a review tho so here it is. You already don't care about small businesses, promote rip offs, and push every upgrade possible when someone signs up for anything, now you want people who paid for a yearly service to pay extra for something that was included when they started using? If I could give a -100 I would.",2024-02-07 03:20:41,1
It's called Prime now with ads. Prime Video costs additional now $2.99 to get no ads. The ads are annoying. I make it a point not to get ripped off by companies and dont ever buy products advertised on this kind of intrusive corporate scam to fleece from customers. Prime is now as sub par as all the other annoying streaming services.,2024-01-31 04:41:51,1

"So a trillion dollar company decided that Prime membership isn't good enough any more. The ad-free promise that we pay for now includes ads, and we have to pay even more to get it ad-free again. And when they decide their new ""premium _ rates aren't good enough, they'll raise them again, and include ads at the rate they're requiring now, and so on, and so on, and so on... Screw you, Bezos. You're not getting any more from me. Prime subscription cancelled.",2024-02-06 04:02:39,1
There are video selection has gotten horrible over time and now they have added ads to all of their content. I refuse to pay $14.99 a month and be forced to watch adds now.

Horrible business practices.. you charge me up front for a year for amazon prime which I was a happy customer for years. Then you added all that freevee garbage and now you force me to pay extra each month if I don't want commercials! Again this is after i already paid for a year of service.Now I have a video service I refuse to use and refuse to pay the extra money for to get your videos without commercials. So not cool Amazon! Prime is only.good for free shipping.,2024-02-18 12:08:05,1
"Besides not properly tracking where I left off on a lot of videos, they're forcing me, as a paying member, to watch ads starting today. They're not a big boy in the streaming service and have some nerve acting like it. They completely ruined the music app, so I switched to Spotify. Now they're ruining video. They have a long way, and lots of work to do before they can make changes like this to customers already dissatisfied with an inability to permanently fix glitches or offer better content.",2024-01-29 23:25:17,1
Amazon started putting ads now in all prime video. Can only get back to ad free for a monthly subscription. This is the last straw for me. I haven't watched ad tv for years and I'm not going to pay extra on top of the annual free for ad free prime. Amazon's quality has gone down hill for years and prices are going up. It's not worth it.,2024-01-29 23:59:17,1
"Honestly, I would have given Prime Video 5-Stars, except for the newly instroduced extra cost to get rid of ads. I will likely not be watching nearly as much (if at all) if I have to watch ads now.

As if they don't charge enough per month, now we have to pay an additional $2.99 to remove ads that weren't there in the first place? Just another money grab from the big companies. Goodbye Prime, it was nice knowing you. I'm deleting everything. What a joke.",2024-02-08 03:25:30,1
Feels like a real scam when you rewind your show because you missed something or left off at an awkward place and it makes you watch ads. And then when it passes the ad point again it makes you watch more. I thought the point of streaming apps was to NOT have to watch 10 minutes of commercials?

"Amazon must have decided to design an app that made it very difficult to find what you want, then challenged themselves to make it worse.

Really sad for them that they've chosen to be such greedy POS. Looks like I'll be canceling Amazon prime due to the new ads feature which means I'll also be finding other places to shop since I won't have the prime delivery service any longer either.

The only way this would have been acceptable was if there was a cheaper version you could get where ads were included.

Love from India. The primary reason for me to stay on Amazon Prime for longer time is because of the availability of subtitles for South Indian regional languages.

We paid even more money totalling around 18$ to watch our show ad free. This did nothing and when I contacted prime for support they told me they don't control the ads and I need to call HGTV.

Not a big deal though, there's still tons of stuff that you can be entertained by. It's even got countless live TV channels.",2024-01-30 11:43:47,5
"I would give 5 stars except for increasingly inappropriate content and when I go to renew my subscription, the app forces me to choose the yearly subscription, rather than the monthly.

"The service used to be awesome, a great addition to justify continuing to pay for prime after 20 years of loyalty. The ads don't overly bother me, but the fact that the volume of the commercials is 10 db higher is not okay. I mute commercials, so congrats on advertising.",2024-01-31 03:50:53,3
PIP mode does not work properly and we can't watch subtitles in PIP. Also for offline download 10 sec fast forward and rewind lags a lot. It takes 4 sec to fwd 10 sec and after that as well black screen displays for a 1 sec and audio is playing in the background,2024-02-07 03:54:05,3
Why cant you just simply copy netflix. So many bugs. I have downloaded an episode and it is not playing. The last series i was watching the audio was not playing in English even after selected english. Its like working on Orkut in the gmail year! Pathetic and worse is the only experience i have for prime.,2024-02-08 10:16:00,1

Very difficult to log in to third party streaming apps if you purchase a subscription through Amazon. Not a big fan of ads either. No ads was the reason why I use to love Amazon prime Video. You have to pay extra to takeaway the ads. Greedy bastards!,2024-02-11 20:13:22,3
"Hey @Amazon Prime could you please add more advertisements, I prefer watching ads over some random series. So if an episode is 30 mins long, please make sure to add 5 ads each with increasing time. Nd if by chance u miss some scenes and go back please continue with your ads again. You ain't giving anything for free, and even though a prime user tries to watch a series. Load them ads.

"Very good App, it's a shame that they want to charge even more for not putting ads when they didn't have them before. It's unfair what they do and other platforms do it too, but they give you the option to pay less if you accept the ads and Prime is now going to charge you for not putting ads. Disappointing.",2024-01-29 19:54:43,2

This is a worthless app I hate ads. There's nothing good to watch. You can watch better stuff on Netflix. No ads better movies. Prime video sucks.,2024-03-08 01:46:53,1
Constantly fails to play anything and thinks it has the right to determine what level of security is allowed on my device. Illegal application reported for malware.

"It was great until they said I needed to pay an extra $3 a month to get ad free on prime video. I'm thinking about canceling my prime membership all together now. What's worse is, they don't tell you the price they want to charge until you're ready to checkout.",2024-01-31 03:26:04,1
This new format is absolutely horrible! Amazon Prime has made it more difficult to watch movies with all of this downloading malarkey and now you have to watch a million more ads. People are paying membership fees to be walked over by this conglomerate and no one cares.,2024-01-28 22:51:14,1

Seriously, prime video is the last streaming service I'd turn to and I only use it now for ONE show, just to find out I have to watch ads now? No thanks. Corporate greed is sincerely getting out of hand. You think people can afford to keep paying more for a non-necessity subscription service in this economy? Get a grip. I'm uninstalling and looking elsewhere.",2024-02-04 05:48:10,1

Its a ripoff!!! I paid my monthly subscription and after a few days I keep getting a message that my subscription details need to be updated I updated it and the message kept showing and before the month was over I needed to pay again for another monthly subscription.

"Amazon is going to lose everything. We lifelong Amazon prime members are really pissed off about you suddenly giving us commercials. It is is a major slap in the face. One of the reasons I keep my Amazon prime subscription is because for the longest time it was ad free. Now they expect us to pay to get rid of advertisements that we didn't have before?

I paid $8 for Oppenheimer and wanted to watch it the next weekend but was faced with a new purchase charge of $8 to finish the movie. It's a digital rental you POS. Greedy Chinese scum Amazon is .",2024-03-13 22:25:57,1

Even offering the 7th season for $24.99, that's more than what I paid for the channel itself. I understand if they haven't released the season and I'm willing to wait. But I do see that they have played these episodes on the live channel why can't I see it after it aired??? Just overall disappointed",2024-02-03 22:19:16,1

Now youre adding ads to peoples subscriptions?? Good lord Amazon is greedy af. They have been doing nothing but adding more and more ads to all their services. I think its time to stop paying for Prime. Theres not really an incentive to keep it anymore. You just get bombarded with ads for everything anyway.,2024-02-07 22:00:45,1
Worst app because if you want to watch your any favourite movies on this app then you have to pay extra rent Even if you have recharged for the entire year but still you will have to pay extra rent. It is better to spend a little more money and take subscription Netflix because there is no extra charge except recharge.😡😡😡😡😡,2024-01-31 17:33:01,1

"They began showing ads... I said this would happen when they started their Freevee BS. There are reasons why streaming became popular and cable TV is dying. One is that people don't like paying to watch commercials! Amazon keeps increasing subscription prices, so why do they need to force ads on us? This blatant money grab depends on the ad space they sell compensating for the few customers that cancel their memberships over this. Switch to other services or sail the seas but eff Amazon!",2024-02-05 21:45:35,1
"The whole reason people pay for subscriptions is to get rid of commercials. Now Prime has added ""limited commercials"" to the beginning of movies and other shows. This is the last straw.

Since COVID I prefer to do my shopping on line.",2024-01-29 20:48:44,4
"Ad-pocalypse is here. Claim to be shorter ads than other services, but are about the same... love how these companies try to squeeze ever more profit out of consumers by making people believe it's a privilege to pay to watch ads.

it's good. But there are many issues 1. The sound quality is far too low. It needs to improve on that 2. The movies that are on rent. Not acceptable. Need to improvise on that 3. The interface is not easy and smooth.,2024-02-02 08:23:32,3

I havw no idea what is going on with this app but I have not been able to play any videos in days. It just loads and loads and it's definitely not my service or wifi because my son is using other apps. I am fixing to give up on it altogether. So infuriating!,2024-01-30 00:36:22,1
It really is awful now with ads. I pay for prime and other subscriptions along with. Now you want more money for no ads. I am canceling all my extra and probably my entire account . I'll go with my phone provider who offers free disney + hulu and netflix for free. No ads there.,2024-02-01 07:02:31,1
I stopped using Amazon music when you added ad's. Now you put ad's on prime video. I saw a $2 charge for shipping on my last Amazon order... I'm confused on the tactics here?

Had to keep phoning as each adviser kept hanging up on me. Got email to say cancelled my Paramount + which I paid year in advance for!

Ridiculous! I started paying for AD Free today on Prime Video, and wouldn't you know, Guess What!.. Still seeing Ads! 60 year Olds watch ads, not this generation!",2024-01-31 07:31:23,2

I currently have prime video and it crashes constantly and battery drains. With the update I did not see where you all have addressed this problem. Hoping that this update is better otherwise I will UNSUBSCRIBE. DO BETTER I pay for this service like many other subscribers. 🤔🤔,2024-02-19 05:32:39,1
Streaming app with a pathetic interface that tries to shove paid content in your face at all times... now they've added ads to their content. Sooner or later they'll remove Prime Video when they realise literally no one on earth paid for Prime for their video library.,2024-02-06 20:37:33,1
I haven't used any of the features yet I am having other problems with my Prime app account. I'm not happy at all with this trying to unsubscribe and cancel my subscription because of the THIRD PARTY WITH GOOGLE PLAY is driving me crazy. Amazon CSR can't help ALL they will hanging up when they can't answer your questions are tell people to CONTACT Google Play Store to handle it because its a third partying issue. Why don't have Prime employees working to help with customers' problems?,2024-03-19 02:52:11,1
Well since u decided the richest company ever needs to include ads . I'm going to stop watching . I bet all your shows go down in views. I don't watch any streaming services with ads.

I'm Disappointed. They are charging extra to skip ads now on top of what I'm already spending for my subscription. I've been a member for almost 2 decades. I don't agree with this new move. I'm a busy guy and don't have time to sit through ads. Considering canceling.,2024-02-01 01:54:27,1

Won't allow me to rent or buy movies anymore. And as of 1/29/24 we have to pay an extra 2.99 to watch things ad free which is ridiculous. The whole point of a streaming service and why people left cable was to avoid ads.,2024-01-30 01:50:02,1
"Why is it suddenly everything I watch has ads? Even the ""prime"" content. The ONLY good thing about Amazon is that Video is already paid for, so NO ADS. If it all has ads now, AFTER alreadying paying for it, I'm done. Doesn't have much good content anymore anyway.",2024-02-21 06:32:55,1

Ive been watching TBBT on there for a few weeks and all of a sudden you have to buy every season. We pay for amazon prime yet still have to pay extra for specific films and shows. Its a joke.

A systematic approach to fool the consumer. Intially launched with non prime and prime membership where prime membership can get benefits. Now everything new is categorised under buy / rent option. This is a good approach to cheat the people.,2024-04-01 02:35:52,1

Disappointed. You pay for Amazon then have to pay for anything decent and then they stick adverts in as well. Netflix is much better,2024-03-29 09:56:25,1
Came back after a long hiatus to watch some invincible. Pretty disappointed in the amount of ads. Won't be watching it here.,2024-04-03 14:36:21,1
Making your product cost more is one thing. Showing ads while changing more for that same product is a brave move Cotton. Let's see if it works out for you.,2024-04-04 21:12:36,1
I love to know the cast of characters in movies especially and that's one of the the things I like about the app . You easily know the characters as you watch. Its been awesome on the app!,2024-04-03 19:58:02,5
"Everything was okay until my subscription was paused due to insufficient funds that I understand but when I tried to pay it asked me to log in again but it just takes me to back to home page. Also when it was working to watch something it would load for like 10mins.

Point is sadly I'm done with prime.",2024-01-02 17:43:17,2

Amazing paying so much money to get ads. Like an absurd amount of apps. Prime video shall now be known as AdsVideo. What an absolute disaster,2024-04-05 05:09:10,1
Quality and ease of Search experience has been deteriorate Moreover if for a majority movies if I have to take additional subscriptions or pay Rent then what's use of paying more for Prime video subscription So not happy with this,2024-04-03 08:22:38,1
Absolute trash. Pay this much to have unskippable ads and have them classify a movie halfway through watching from available to available to rent or buy,2024-04-03 02:37:29,1

Update: basic playback not working properly The worst search filters a steaming app can have. Please work on the basics. I need to enter the exact title name or it won't show any relevant results. I had rated full stars before hoping you'd work on this later. Been using this app for long and never saw an improvement in that area.,2023-11-21 17:18:56,1

As if Amazon wasn't rich enough they have started putting ads into their content. You're a disgrace amazon and I'm taking my money back.,2024-04-12 19:15:48,1
This multibillion dollar company can't invest in a decent streaming app? Trying to rewind will mess up your whole stream. It either freezes up or puts you back at the very beginning. Amazon doesn't release episodes soon enough. Something that aired 2 days ago still hasnt been added into the app and I even PAID for the season. Total garbage app.,2023-12-23 20:14:03,1

It works great for me. No issues that you won't find with any other streaming service.,2024-04-14 22:10:51,5

sound quality is very bad..one cant listen what someone is speaking in a movie or a series...this is a major drawback of this app...,2024-03-29 13:23:33,1

Why I should buy the movies on rent after taking the subscription also. And so many bugs in tv fix that.,2024-04-20 15:31:23,3
You wanna throw ads at me after all this time. I guess Netflix it is. There's also plenty of free vidoe apps with ads.... U messed up with me.,2024-02-27 10:08:40,1
ads ruined prime. I'm not going to pay more for 2nd rate streaming service. Not having ads is all it really had going for it,2024-04-01 21:21:58,2

"I would Gove it more stars but for the cost.... it should have more movies included.... not movies with ads..... that's stupid.

Prime has a wide range of entertainment from different genres to time length and the serious to mindless films when you just want to relax. There are also different categories from kids shows to a variety of sports and news prógrams. I also like the rating system showiñg what other viewers thought of the film. There is truly something for everyone on Prime. 👍,2023-12-01 00:34:21,5
I ❤️ this app. I use in on my tablet when on travel besides on my television at home. I enjoy the variety of shows that are offered and the ease of navigating the site.,2024-03-18 07:14:19,5

This app is constantly dropping my movies or Prime series while. Takes several reopenings of the app to resume my videos on my smart TV. Other streaming channels do not have this problem! O -limlne tips say yo enable the auto-update feature in settings. That doesn't seem to help at all!! May have to cancel subscription??,2023-11-28 23:13:10,2
Not good for streaming shows. Does not play shows in consecutive order and app on phone doesn't sync with TV app.,2024-03-06 19:27:43,1
DO NOT SUBSCRIBE! Worst streaming service that exists. 99% of the content is just ads for you to buy them or subscribe to another service. You will spend hours just trying to find 1 or 2 things that aren't absolute garbage that you can actually watch. I believe this is a bait and switch scam that is DEFINETLY a bad idea if you have kids since they will end up buying half the titles. Whoever came up with this platform deserves to go to prison.,2024-04-24 07:48:31,1

I have been a prime member for a long time and I pay a lot for it I shouldn't have to see commercials and the video feed and quality has been bad I am siruosly considering canceling my membership if I wanted to see commercials I would watch regular TV,2024-03-25 18:53:05,1
I think it's an awesome platform with various add in packages that aren't too much more with the additional fee for Amazon Prime!,2024-03-22 04:06:20,5
"Ads are getting longer and more frequent, it used to be ad free when I signed up. The price has also gone up even with the ads.",2024-03-05 01:44:32,3
"Terrible, already paying for Prime and I still get ads. Outrageous that you want more money on top to experience the adless version again.",2024-02-07 11:48:25,1
Why video quality dropped on app. I am not able to choose and view full HD content on app. This was not the case before.,2024-03-12 15:42:29,2
The app works just fine but it kinda feels dead... It could be the theme but I don't know why I don't get excited when opening it. Are there no previews on tablets and smart phones?,2024-03-10 20:43:40,3
"I like the app and the selection of films available, especially Amazon productions. It's improving continuously.",2024-03-03 00:23:55,5
"There is something wrong with the app, I can't really watch it, it freezes my screen or there's grainy things. Please fix this issue.",2024-03-21 21:02:00,4
I really love the variety of shows and movies. The only thing I would ask is could the shuffle episodes be out on more 30 min TV shows? I love using this function for the Big Bang Theory.,2024-03-12 03:07:33,4
Didn't pay for commercials. Maybe someday technology will be able to give a full description without having to click on the show. Thanks to the ads bozos is now the richest man in the world so there is that,2024-03-06 22:30:21,1
Can't fix black screen issue. Idk why it happened all of sudden. Disabling hw acceleration helps but it won't run in hd quality then. Fix the damn thing.,2024-03-23 03:17:38,2
Ruin by unskippable ads. Can never find what I am looking for. I don't want to pay for a movie. Just show me the stuff that I've paid for with prime.,2024-02-18 17:44:51,1
Doesn't work with Chromecast Ultra. Get green bars across screen with working audio. Basically makes content unwatchable on Chromecast.,2024-02-28 02:34:11,1
It's amazing 👏 but need more options very limited movies and series. Half of what you wanna watch ain't there. Maybe it's the SA sever but only thing that needs improvement,2024-03-16 00:06:46,5
Ads almost every time I skip forward to find where I left off last time have made this service pretty much unwatchable. Very poor.,2024-02-22 20:54:42,1
"Nope. They've put really intrusive ads in the middle of programmes now, so we've cancelled our subscription. Don't bother, the ads have ruined prime video",2024-02-13 20:36:18,1
Now all the shows that we enjoyed as a family having a Prime account we have to pay extra to watch after the update but the app works fine but what is the point of paying for prime video if we have to pay extra to enjoy the shows that was once accessible on prime now not?,2024-02-24 03:10:28,1
"Was working perfect, but now every video I try to play I get an error message that says, ""video unavailable, we've encountered a problem with this video. Please try again. Error code:5001.""",2024-03-11 18:35:55,4
I find it appalling that a paid service sees the need to include ads. I agree that YouTube's ad campaign is downright infuriating but I see this as a sad gateway into further annoyance with more ads to come.,2024-02-14 11:30:59,1
Here's the deal. You're now paying a subscription to be advertised to. Unless of course you want to...drum roll...pay to have have them removed. A con whichever way you look at at.,2024-02-27 13:41:10,1
"If I keep getting ads before the movie/series starts, I will be canceling my sub. I pay to use the service so I should not get ads in any form....",2024-03-13 13:48:46,2
Would have been 5 stars but there are too many ads now. If i wanted 6 ads per ad break and 6 ad breaks per movie i would just watch movies on cable,2024-02-12 00:32:49,2
Paying for ads with a company that makes billions is insane. I recommend going back to piracy. Streaming is only good as long as it's more convenient than cable TV and pirating.,2024-02-19 01:32:39,1
"It kept logging me out. I had to log in each time I wanted to watch something. Ultimately, the account was locked due to ""detected unusual activity on my account"".",2024-02-19 21:00:49,1
Now being charged an extra £2.99 to watch ad free. I think I will close my account and go elsewhere to the many other platforms which are not trying to hold their subscribers to ransom.,2024-02-19 19:08:41,1
Ads? And you want us to pay more to stop them aren't you rich enough. I pay for Prime membership and spend alot on shopping on Amazon. This is a terrible way to treat loyal customers,2024-03-07 23:47:18,1
All of the best tvs are easily accessible through one app!!! Yes it might be a bit pricey! But I will always be a PRIME>NETFLIX,2024-03-04 16:38:26,5

Why put ads on a paid for service. Especially 20 second unskippable ads that aren't even remotely related to the content you are viewing. Utterly pointless move.,2024-02-22 11:46:35,1
"Streaming sucks and they put ads. I need prime for shopping only. Don't waste your time watching their five ads at the beginning, middle and end.",2024-02-22 21:39:36,1
"It's OK, but now I have to pay an extra 2.99 to remove ads they've put on. It's still cheaper than netflix, though.",2024-03-17 17:44:14,5
"This mite be the best streaming app I've ever experienced, and that is mainly do to how non-biased it is I can find a range of different movies such as religious, action-packed super heros, or even horror movies, and sometimes a mix of the in between. I just sincerely hope that it can stay that way!:)",2023-11-21 15:26:20,5
Why even show the titles that aren't available? Triplets of the same episode on listing you have to figure out which on will work terribly organized. Sort your stuff out prime it used to be good now its the worst streaming app,2024-03-18 03:03:34,1
"Good service, good price. But why won't it let me download Fallout to watch on the plane?",2024-04-13 20:38:35,4
Everything lags. Subtitles won't work. And both the TV and mobile version takes forever to start.,2024-02-25 10:08:13,1
The app interface is pretty garbage it's hard to find what you are looking for. Unskippable apps on paid subscriptions Total rip,2024-03-25 20:33:16,1
Garbage app. Having ads is one thing. Having ads that blast at 1.5x the volume of what you're watching is another and is completely unacceptable.,2024-02-10 22:23:24,1
It's not really good I prefer Netflix because it has more shows and is more entertaining than Amazon Prime the only thing I wish they had on the kids account is more big kid movies and shows for my kids.,2024-02-27 10:17:27,2
I really don't like the change to continue watching. Not everyone wants it to auto play. There should be an option to set it rather than just force us to change.,2024-03-14 19:56:18,1
I have logout of all devices and trying login with new phone. Amazon prime video is showing still logged in another device. Tried multiple uninstall and install. Still it is problem horria app it is,2024-03-09 20:47:19,1

"So much better than cable ever was. However, having to pay even more than it already costs is a usurous practice, especially since freevee already exists. Please reconsider this charge on a charge.",2024-03-21 18:47:18,3
I bought a tv series and then a subscription to paramount that the series is included with. So I'm now having to watch ads on something that I purchased. Why am I watching ads on something that I purchased????,2024-02-24 03:33:45,2
"Full subscription isn't enough for them, ask8ng for extra 36 per year. We were still getting ads as trailers befaore any content, Now this. Canceling it after my subscription is done.",2024-03-02 04:52:40,1
Worst app every hour it crashes. You guys no where near the content like Netflix and can't have a running app. Pls let me know help fix your UI. Pathetic app with worse UI. Ask your test team and developers to take refreshers.,2024-03-08 09:35:46,1
Prime is trash now. You pay almost $15 a month and have to watch mandatory ads. Lower the price if I have to watch ads.,2024-02-19 01:44:56,1
Still garbage ads before you watch anything and now they put more ads in the middle unless you add an additional 2.99 a month to your subscription. Joke of a streaming service.,2024-02-15 00:22:52,1
Canceling due to ads and especially not being able to browse only prime movies. It has become too much of a pain.,2024-03-11 23:33:08,2
Why am I having to watch adds now when I'm paying a subscription.The original reason I started paying for prime video is because i didn't have to watch adds now u want more money to remove adds if that's the case then I shouldn't have to pay for a subscription,2024-02-11 22:21:46,1
"You will find every movie in search suggestions, but 90 percent of the movies don't even exist on the platform. Worst app.",2024-03-06 03:21:04,1

"SO NOW WE CAN'T FAST FOWARD ANYMORE THAN 10 SECONDS AT A TIME... SERIOUSLY.... TAKING EVERY AMAZING FEATURE AWAY! AND DON'T GET ME STARTED QITH THE ""ADS"".... It's becoming a typical cable box holding us hostage forcing us watch UNWANTED ADS over and over again.",2024-02-24 09:16:51,2
People always look at the negatives 3.99 to rent movies is cheap compared to the rest of the streaming apps out there,2024-04-18 22:44:40,4
Extremely disappointed with their new initiative of starting advertising mid series. Is this the reason of paying for prime benefits we would rather watch it on YouTube. Please reconsider your decision.,2024-02-15 13:10:48,1
"Download always stops when u started watching downloaded videos,battery saver is off despite downloading is stopped when screen goes off,Plz bring in the Greys anatomy, The arrow,the flash,supergirl,and many more marvel and dc tv series which r more anticipated r missing So sad amazon doesnt providing this,instead investing money on other bollywood craps like coolie no.1 and many morè",2024-02-29 18:26:19,1

"Too expensive and not enough content. Purchased content can only be watched on the app, you can't download files to your PC.",2024-03-01 22:24:11,1

"Only few movies and series are free but we are paying.... Other movies which are released as best like Nun 2, Openheimer and more are put on rent.... Then why are we paying if we have to pay again? I love their series and everything but the only problem is this rent system",2024-03-12 05:44:08,3
Useless content and everyting is paid or rented even after prime. Netflix is amazing. They remove content after few days like kgf 1 removed. That's the cause subscribers are going down. They would loose fit.,2024-03-23 19:45:37,1
"Well in prime. I can watch top gear specials and a new grand tour came out. Also these people in the comments are petty cause ads aren't a problem. It takes two minutes to watch an advert, disappointing how adults can't do that",2024-02-18 22:43:49,5

Worst experience ever. I have mobile subscription and then when I actually try to watch something it says you can only watch on one device. And I literally have signed in on a single device... WTH,2024-02-23 19:39:27,1
You pay $99 a year only to but subjected to 5 minutes of ads every time a new episode starts or you fast forward. They say limited ads but thats all it is. Amazon is going to trash at our expense.,2024-02-12 21:40:10,1

"""Open in External Browser"" has been broken for quite some time now. Everyone has a browser of choice already set... Hint: it isn't FB's browser! ü§® Fix it and I'll consider upping my review score. Another annoying issue is the auto-refresh function. If I; or others, wish to refresh the screen then we'll do just that. And of course, it inevitably happens in the middle of reading a post. Completely unnecessary function and not needed whatsoever.",2024-04-09 01:29:41,1
"It's worked in the past, but for the last few days (an update, perhaps?) when my phone is folded there's an ugly bar on the left side that blocks the content on my feed. When I unfold it, the screen keeps flickering and jittering and it can't be interacted with. I've tried uninstslling and reinstalling, didn't help. Maybe it's a feature.",2024-04-14 20:28:10,1
"Facebook apparently did not test the new layout on many devices. They repositioned the task bar (home, marketplace, etc.) from the top to the side. For mobile, where most devices have more screen top to bottom than left to right, this is bad design. The problem comes when you are on a device that is more narrow. The new layout on a folded Z Fold 4 is nearly unusable. This new bar takes up so much space and squeezes the feed. Something as simple as the comments button has to wrap to a new line.",2024-04-11 18:51:41,2
"HELP! I have a Galaxy Z-Fold, and since the last update, my Facebook is constantly ""refreshing"" and bringing me back to the top. Example: looking at pictures in a post from a friend, hitting the back button when done, and I'm no longer at the post, I'm back to the top. Look at a video or Reel... same thing, back to the top. It's slow to load again, too. Terrible! Please fix it!!!!!!!",2024-04-23 16:21:02,3
"I can't get rid of the AI search. I've followed instructions. There is not a toggle to turn it off. I have the latest version of facebook. The option to remove it and put back the original search is not under navigation, security, privacy, or anywhere else. I have followed four different instructions, including the one provided by their AI.. I WANT MY SEARCHBAR BACK! Will never recommend facebook until they remove the AI search.",2024-04-24 20:15:14,1
"Completely unusable with my Z fold 4. First issue is that in folded mode, it now keeps the same layout of unfolded mode. Can't see half of the posts and it looks awful. After using it this way for a bit, eventually the ui elements overlap and I can't click anything. Second issue(which I realize is a ""feature"" is that when I click on messenger while unfolded, it splits the screen. Sounds like a good idea, but it looks horrible. If I wanted to split the apps, I would do it myself.",2024-04-18 19:12:41,1
"I do not like the automatic sound on media. I have the setting turned off. After an update, the feature isn't working correctly. I used to click on a reel and the volume would stay off after I scrolled through my newsfeed. Now, the volume is on. I know I can turn off the volume by the little speaker in the video. That's not the point. My setting reflects that it's off. There have been two updates and this is still occurring. It's annoying.",2024-04-19 23:11:49,1
"I use Facebook quite a bit, but with the new layout of the app on my zfold4, it is annoying. The news feed, videos, marketplace, etc, are on the side from top to bottom instead of on top left to right. It cuts off some of the posts, and in order to view the entire post, you have to click it to view the post in full form. Also, when you go to videos or your profile and then choose to go back to news feed, all of the news feed, videos, etc, buttons are all scrunched and are literally overlapping.",2024-04-19 02:17:33,3
"I have used FB extensively for years and I love the platform. The reason for my 2-stars is because of a bug, when I rotate my phone from vertical to horizontal on my Samsung S24 Ultra the pictures on the Facebook app do not auto rotate, meaning I cannot see horizontal photos full screen. This is very annoying to me and frustrating. Any other app like Android Gallery would auto rotate the photos. I checked all settings and spent hours trying to fix this with no success.",2024-04-23 21:49:10,2
"Not folding device friendly. Opens in tablet mode on the small screen so the side bar takes up half the screen. You have to switch screens back and forth to get the bar to the top, but then all media becomes oversized and cropped off. Also, refreshes the app every time you switch screens so you will lose your place. Frequently brings up month old posts. Also, snoozing is pointless because once the month ends, they shove everything you specifically wanted to avoid right into your face.",2024-04-20 17:26:08,1
"Got rid of og videos - now only reels, which no one wants. Usually on FB 8+ hrs/day. I cant use as is. Everyone wants the regular videos as well as the reels. Most of us watch the videos with subtitles, at dif speed options, full screen, etc that reels does not provide. Reels also doesn't show like videos. If I'm watching a rug cleaning video at 2 am I don't want a video about domestic violence. I want more satisfying videos like more rug cleaning videos. Just have both. No one wants this.",2024-04-23 14:15:33,1
Galaxy Fold 4 here and the app is awful now on the front screen with the navigation bar on the left side of the screen taking up almost half of it. Hard to see anything and it usually glitches again and you can't even select any of the options. Been this way for almost a month now and not a fix in sight. Uninstalling and installing it again gives you maybe a few minutes or an hour until it goes right back.,2024-04-18 21:56:32,1
"Ever since the recent update, the layout changed on the Z fold and it smashes everything together so that the different menu buttons can be on the left instead of on top. It's become pretty much unusable on the outer screen and you frequently have to clear all the data and never close the app to get a short term fix that doesn't always work.",2024-04-21 12:47:43,1
"No longer really usable on my phone, since after OS update today the navigation bar takes up a huge amount of the left side of my screen, making it so I can't even read or see pictures conveniently. Nice break. Oh and then also the navigation bar occasionally shrinks to be so small that it can't be cooked on effectively. So it's either way too big, or it's way too small. Genius. Galaxy Z-Fold 4, outside screen.",2024-04-11 05:51:48,1
"I really don't mind a lot of things about the app that could /should be better but, I've had to use the galaxy fold phone due to work and, the integration of the app is just bad. Since I can't pin the navigation bar, whenever I open the app it's always on the left, as if in tablet mode (even when it's not), making the feed display smaller. I don't like that menu there even in tablets. And the stories count is the same in phone mode as in tablet mode, so they become tiny in phone mode. Fix!",2024-04-17 03:38:04,2
"The option to open links in an external browser has conveniently stopped working. And I cannot even begin to describe how terrible of an idea it is to implement an AI feature in place of the damn search function. I don't want to ask it a question, I JUST WANT TO SEARCH FOR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK. You know??? Like the entire point of the app to begin with???? Are you guys brain dead???????",2024-04-25 06:50:15,1
With the lastest update for the zfold four the navigation bar has shifted to the left side rather than at the top. I could probably deal with this if it weren't for the fact that it constantly glitches and all the options overlay each other and the option to share gets eaten behind the navigation bar. The only fix so far has been to click on a link I share to someone and then it temporarily brings back the navigation bar to the top until it changes back again eventually. Please fix this.,2024-04-23 05:16:59,2
"As if fb wasn't bad enough, they pushed out a forced change moving the navigation bar to the left side of the device. No accessibility options to change this. This renders the app extremely difficult to use on Samsung fold or flip phones as they are skinnier and taller than most phones, causing the amount of usable screen to be diminished even further. In a world of vertical smartphones, some yahoo thought it was a good idea to put the navigation bar on the longest side, shrinking visible space.",2024-04-11 16:16:45,1
"The newest update moved the navigation bar to the left-side of the screen, which is the absolute WORST place for it. It fit across the top with little interference with the rest of my screen. Now, its taking up space from my news feed and I can't read or see posts, I have to click on every single post to see it. Uninstalling this garbage now.",2024-04-11 13:55:00,1
"maybe it's just me but i find the entire interface incredibly difficult to navigate. i have such a difficult time trying to do anything but post to news feed or react to other's posts. i dislike the entire experience. i can't figure out the whole ""story"" thing, i can't figure out how to add or select music for it, i can't figure out my shop page and how to manage it... i guess I'm just not cut out for fb ü§∑üèª",2024-04-24 02:59:11,2
Today it gets one star.... please remove the recent update that makes it impossible to use Facebook on the fold phones. The layout was perfectly fine the way it was. I don't understand why you would go and put the settings and notifications bar on the left side of the screen and it also appears to have changed what I'm actually seeing instead of just seeing my feed. I can't even see anything to try and navigate through the app,2024-04-19 22:51:31,1
"I am not inherently against AI, but the way AI has been newly integrated into this app, without a way to disable it (so that they can collect data to teach their language model) is not something I can get behind. Along with the fact they state how much our privacy matters to the company, but yet you have to go through layers & layers of settings to adjust the privacy settings (& some settings don't really allow you to opt out of data that is shared) & then it doesn't seem to make a difference.",2024-04-21 21:52:03,1
"I have enjoyed this app for years, but this most recent update is garbage. It moved the tabs from the top to the left side, thereby making all of the content on the feed, video, etc tabs smaller. On my phone, after viewing the ""recent update"" tab thing, all of the tabs think into one overlaying tab. I then have to close and reopen the app to have them reset. It is just annoying.",2024-04-14 20:53:26,2
"I don't know what facebook did, but I can't stand it anymore. I won't bother using it. The UI had changed and is terrible with navigation on the side. Sometimes it's up in the top somewhere where you have no access. Good luck changing figuring it out yo change it. I get tons of ads or videos that have nothing to do with me. Languages I don't speak. What good is that for me. I put ""not interested"" and whatever I can think of to curb what Meta thinks I want, but it's AI is an idiot. I could go on.",2024-04-14 17:39:28,1
"I have a z fold 4, and my facebook app updated today. It now has all the tabs on the left side of my screen, and the feed to the right of it. Everything is cut off, and it doesn't fit. The tabs shrink up to the point of not being able to press any of them, much less even know what they are. This is an awful, awful, AWFUL update! Please fix it!",2024-04-11 20:54:30,1
"I really hope Facebook sees this because I'm at a loss for how else to get the issue fixed. Facebook's newest update has made the app unusable for Galaxy Fold phones. It switches the notification tab from the top of the screen to the side, smooshing all the posts. Even worse, when you scroll, you lose access to the notification tab altogether, leaving white space. I have to close out the app because I'm unable to access messenger or refresh. I've switched to using Chrome to access the site.",2024-04-12 11:19:56,1
"No way to turn off all the garbage they throw at you. Good luck finding any of the stuff your friends post. Update: Still mostly ads and garbage. Still don't see anything from the people I actually know. Also, everything is smashed and doesn't fit on the phone screen with the notification bar on the side now for some reason... Massive failure of an app.",2024-04-11 19:37:46,1
This latest update has made it unusable. I don't know if this is across all devices but on a Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 you can't access the side panel. Your feed is super cramped when using the front screen. It's awful. It seems like what was intended for when the middle screen is folded out and being used is now on the front screen and that's what makes it unusable.,2024-04-12 20:19:15,1
"Using on the Galaxy Z Fold5 and after the last update the front screen has the navigation bar on the left side of the screen, causing the news feed to be thin and annoying. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't fix it. I've tried multiple other ways and nothing has worked. Please fix this. Guess I'll just use Lite for now.",2024-04-24 05:13:20,2
"Update: This app has become clickbait only. Unless you were to go into the ""Feeds"" option under your profile, then all you're seeing is ""suggested for you"" clickbait with AI images, bots, and low quality content. Toggling the news feed options has not helped one bit. Marketplace has improved Original: Marketplace is poorly designed. I want the items that are actually locally for sale, instead of online listings and random ads. It is hard to find anything without specifically searching for it.",2024-04-18 15:21:02,1
"Every update they make, the app gets worse. The notification disappear while scrolling. Why? Because they want to svae you 3% of your screen real estate I guess. Totally dumb and useless. Notifications don't appear properly anymore, you have to click a button to see additional notifications. FB just seems to be regressing. No wonder the platform is dying.",2024-04-17 13:35:45,1
AWFUL!!! üòî I don't know what upgrade happened within the last two weeks but my Samsung Galaxy fold does not work properly! Absolutely positively utterly disgusted!! I do not want my navigation bar on the left I'll squashed up so I can't read anything! I want it back on the top of the page...so fix it!! IMMEDIATELY!!! TERRIBLE!!!üò°üò°üò°,2024-04-23 23:31:26,1
"Notifications don't come through until hours later. It's usually 2 hours or more before I see a post from my boss in a group for my 2nd job. The ratio between suggested pages and posts from my actual friends is 70/30 at this point. It's too much. The current layout is a jumbled, glitchy mess. The previous layout was totally fine, but now everything is too small because the navigation bar is on the side. App still hasn't been optimized for folding devices, as I have the Z Fold 4.",2024-04-12 14:39:36,1
"The app works usually, but it constantly changes the app settings back to the defaults (start videos with sound being a major one). This has become an almost daily issue where I have to readjust app settings. Edit: I had to bump the stars down because the issue is getting more frequent, and the occurrences of seeing inappropriate things on the timeline is ridiculous.",2024-04-10 20:25:25,2
It's been a year since my last review. Nothing has changed. Facebook app is broken. They've refused to fix it. Every second item on your feed is a Spam ad that can never be removed or blocked. The three dot Function menu does nothing. And trying to even block a single ad. Will crash the app. Or it will lock the app or cause functional errors that disable using it without a complete restart of your entire phone.,2024-04-06 14:04:40,1
"The latest update performed rendered my mobile app almost unusable on the Fold 4. The Shortcut bar moved from the top of the screen to the left side of the screen, causing it to take up 60% of the News Feed. Not to mention that when you click on a shortcut, they all colapse on top of each other causing you to have to quit the app and return.",2024-04-11 20:02:51,1
"The installation of the Meta AI on the search bar makes the app nearly useless for finding people or events because it opens up a text thread with AI instead of giving you what you asked for. I've been trying to remove it, but all the instructions I've found online don't seem to work on my phone. This could be the final nail in the coffin for my use of this app.",2024-04-22 03:22:17,1
"The recent app update is absolutely horrendous. The left side is now dominated by the menu bar, squishing the content I actually want to see into a much smaller space. So much space is wasted in the lower left. Why in the world was this change made? The menu bar was perfectly fine at the top. The app now looks awful. Please change it back.",2024-04-12 19:58:00,1
Z Fold 5 user here. Opened the app today and found that the navigation bar has been moved to the left side of the screen when using the front screen (I almost always use the front screen while scrolling FB). This change makes the app completely unusable on my front screen due to the bar taking up about a quarter of my real estate. And I can't seem to find any setting to move the bar back to the top. Ridiculous,2024-04-12 19:50:32,1
Rereview. This is still an app I would give 0 stars if I could. I'm now experiencing an OBNOXIOUS spike in ads. Seriously. After getting an ad after the first post in my feed I'll get another one after every three posts. It honestly makes me want to go straight to the pages for the groups I'm part of to look at the posts for them. I would try to use an ad blocking app to view it on my phone. But I have a bad feeling Meta will eventually go to war with adblockers like Google is right now.,2024-04-24 16:11:07,1
The new update for Facebook is terrible for the z fold phones barely any room to read anything on the front screen the app forces me to open the phone completely to even be able to read anything. Placing the navigation bar on the left side of the screen is a bad idea. At least make it so I can change where I want the location of the bar.,2024-04-13 12:36:55,2
"I have a z fold samsung and all was ok till a week or so ago,now facebook is total trash unless you jump through hoops to make it work. The problem is the navigation bar moved to the left and all the articles are jumbled to the right. You can of course log out and back in in hopes it works or open the z foldto full screenthen close it to use the front screen. I as well as others are getting frustrated with this.",2024-04-21 06:40:30,1
"Originally, one stared for all the ads but had to delete the review to bow complain about the app not being usable. I can't even read things on the screen anymore. They moved the slectuon bar from the top to the left. At the top, it took up 1/12th of the screen, but the new one takes up 1/5 of the screen. I have a giant black bar on the left side of my screen now, and I am not exaggerating. Using my calipers, my screen is approximately 55mm across, with the left bar being approximately 11mm.",2024-04-12 17:25:09,1
"Facebook is a great platform, but the software is buggy. Everyone I ask have one or two issues. I am a lucky one that has multitudes of issues. From delayed or missing notifications, to posts that don't appear, to messages that I never receive. I've given up on Facebook support. After spending way too much time trying to explain it isn't my computer (some issues they can replicate) and each time I am 'helped' things get worse, I have given up on trying to get support.",2024-03-29 05:33:23,3

"I've withstood all the random changes/updates over the years, but their Meta AI might just be the update that pushes me to delete my account. It's intrusive, at least its placement is, and it should be placed in a non-central area not right at the search bar. For users, generally older ones, who are not computer savvy, their placement of it isn't fair as they wouldn't readily figure out that Meta AI is not the same as the Search function so it seems predatory by Facebook to do this.",2024-04-24 06:46:24,1
"I am not happy with the latest update. I don't like that my navigation bar was moved to the left side of my screen, and there is no option to move it back to the top. Also, when I click on the hamburger menu bars, it automatically shrinks down to one squished little symbol, kind of like all the pinned shortcuts are squished into one. I hope this gets fixed / changed so we have the option to move it back to the top.",2024-04-19 09:49:54,1
"For the Galaxy Fold 4, the new update is awful. The new update with the home button down the side instead of across the top in phone mode makes it so that I can't see half the stuff posted now because the timeline is scrunched vertically. The only way to use the app is if I open my phone to tablet mode. I'd post a picture to show, but there isn't that option.",2024-04-20 19:41:11,2
"Reels are basically unmoderated and awful. They start showing you animal abuse disguised as ""saving"" animals. No matter how many times you select ""show less"" it never learns. Hiding a reel also does nothing as it will just show back up again once you refresh the page. Also you can't block Instagram users in the reels that show up in Facebook for some reason.",2024-04-08 07:57:32,1
Using the Z Fold 4 and the new update has made the navigation bar huge and now located on the left side of the screen. Making it nearly impossible to see or read anything.

"For whatever reason people can't share links to videos in either Facebook or Instagram with me that work. The app and device are both running the latest updates, the device is also updated, and this issue has lasted for three app updates at this point.

"Video viewing is a horrendous experience on Facebook. They removed the scrub bar, so you can't go forward or rewind. Sometimes if you pause a video, it will restart at the beginning when you press play. Some videos will just pause randomly and either resume playing after skipping ahead, or just refuse to play past a certain point.

"Completely out of touch. Constantly switching on options you turned off (like starting videos with sound). Every time they add a new feature it becomes progressively worse, more counter-intuitive and . Popularity algorithms are a horrible idea.

I've been checking it periodically bc it has done it 2x now. It keeps saying I have a message when there is not. I wish it didn't show all your ""friends"" everything you do.

It also crashed/froze three times while swiping. If you swipe, button inputs will stop working. On top of that, 90% of the people I see are over 100 miles away and I live in a major city!

But now that I can't remove the app from my phone, and they have a new AI system that isn't very subtle about it accessing things beyond its limits, (contacts, payment information, location history, Google account information for all accounts associated with yours, and even bank account information, etc.) I am very concerned with my safety.

I have FB for marketplace only. When I take pictures of stuff to sell the pictures come out great. Then once I post them to marketplace the colors get distorted.

Impossible to watch reels now. Anytime you try to open one it will take you to the reels page and start playing a completely unrelated video. No way to watch the one you clicked on except to scroll through the posters page until you find it and MAYBE it will work.

I feel you need to be more aware of who you let on this app. Nothing online is 100 percent secure.it gets very annoying because I keep having to make numerous accounts all the time.

"I enjoy the convenience of Facebook, however you are constantly having to change your settings after every update. The app is extremely pushy in changing your settings and trying to force downloads, settings you have no interest in and saving items.

"Videos keep switching to use the Reel player instead of the usual video player. I hate the reel player, especially for videos. There are buttons that appear on top of the video that cannot be hidden, and it repeats the same video instead of serving up another video on the same show.

Also, within the last few months it will not allow my phone to auto rotate to landscape for any pictures or to live stream.

Got caught in a session expired loop with an up to date app and phone software. Literally no reason to continue to refuse me access to my account I've had for more than a decade. As soon as I log in I get a session expired message. It's done this 6 times this morning. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Didn't help. I wouldn't be so bent out of shape if some of the last messages from my dead father weren't on that account. Do better.,2024-03-05 15:45:55,1
"Terrible UI/UX design. There is no way that any developer work a grain of salt would be okay with releasing garbage like this.

Only the start of posts are now visible, clicking ""more"" does nothing so I can only read the first part of friends' posts, and even clicking on comments is hit and miss as to whether they open. Plus the ongoing complaint of irrelevant ads (I, a bald man, receive regular ads for hair slides) and reduced inclusion of friends' updates is making me use the app less.",2024-04-08 10:20:49,1

"One of the worst apps with full of bugs, especially on video playback. If you click on a video, instead of playing there on the timeline, it'll take you to the video tab and will show you a different video. Sometimes the play button vanishes on some videos as you scroll in the video tab and the thumbnails appear as images only. Sometimes when you try to save a video by clicking on options, it'll erroneously show options about the ad of the video. It's a shame for such a reputed company.",2024-04-19 04:25:12,1

Whoever is the UI and UX designer keeps making the app worse and worse to the point where it's not even a social media platform. Latest update made the content size smaller and the navigation on the left instead of the top. Does not feel natural at all to use.

Then there are the Reels, I don't know anything about those, whether it's people I'm following that post those or where they come from.

Its format could use some revamping. It's a bit boring that it's the same as it's always been. Options for different formats would.be fun. It glitches in landscape view. I find it would be nice if you could choose exactly what you'd see each day. A list you could make In order of what you want to see. I find it too random and often shows you very little of what you want to see. Still it's nice to find artist etc that you want to learn from. I think it could focus more on community.,2024-03-21 08:07:12,3

Lol are you guys shutting down? Do we need to save all our old pictures and memories? Every update just degrades the quality more.

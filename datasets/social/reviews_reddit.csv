It's a good app to connect with communities. I've used it for years with hardly any complaints. Lately they keep making changes to the user interface where it is much less usable and more of an eyesore than ever before. It's beginning to look very unprofessional and elementary. No need to fix what wasn't broken! With the changes in user interface comes SO many bugs and glitches. The app is sometimes unscrollable with the constant errors. The app was fine before..,2024-04-15 23:45:01,2
"Seriously how could they make it this bad? Videos always play in full screen. There's no setting to turn that off. The only way to pause is a tiny button in the lower left corner when it's in full screen, but if you tap the comments icon, it moves to the lower right. Even when tapping on a non video post the screen refreshes as if it's trying to go full screen. You can't swipe through postings in the order that you have them displayed, it just shows the next similar one however they define it.",2024-04-23 03:24:26,2
"Downgraded original 3* review since the video player has become even more wonky, and they removed the ability to sort your feed by recent, hot, etc. It's annoying to have to go into Settings to sort, while individual subreddits still allow for sorting from the menu bar. I hope this ""feature"" is reverted soon. (General navigation still sucks, but I had gotten used to it.)",2024-04-18 12:02:39,3
"They constantly introduce terrible features that are half baked at best and offer no way to disable. This app should be a case study in how to poorly design a UI. The terrible ""feature"" this time is automatically swiping to the next post when in full screen mode. The problem is that gesture is already used to swipe to see the next image in a gallery. It just makes it so confusing when you think there are more images and you just get sent to the next post.",2024-04-18 16:57:43,1
"Horizontal swiping is near useless because it's mapped to both image collections and the tab layout. And on the topic of gestures, they added even more! Now, when viewing a photo or photo set, swiping takes you to an entirely new post if you've reached the end of it. I absolutely hate this feature, but it can't even be turned off. And there's nowhere in the app to provide feedback, so here I am, voicing my complaints in a review that no one will read.",2024-04-06 14:44:23,1
"The UI change and the fact that the app just completely stopped loading the comment sections is so bad. Like the app has been declining significantly for a while. Like when they changed pause/play from being a big button in the middle of the screen to being a tiny button in the left corner, horrible choice for accessibility. Or when they made it that sometimes when you click an image on the right it just opens the post, trash. Just trash. They made me open Instagram. INSTAGRAM. Please stop",2024-04-02 21:36:47,1
"Updating to say this app is still garbage and is unlikely to improve. I miss pre-2010s Internet. Now everything look the same, but none of it works. The official app is horrific. The UI is ugly and difficult, but half the features are just busted. I can't scro up without the app thinking I'm trying to refresh. Backing out of a thread makes the fees refresh and change the order of posts. I miss having a reliable app.",2024-04-07 17:28:27,1
"Why are there no options to change text size, and why on earth would lock the app to portrait mode? The app is bloated and a very clear case of form over function. Reddit needs to go back to its roots and simplify the app and add more accessibility options. Update: With every update the app gets worse. Opening posts will freeze the app. Scrolling Tok far will freeze the app and the next page will not load. App slows to a crawl then freezes if it is open too long.",2024-04-15 23:36:01,1
"App continues to have a myriad of issues that have not been repaired, while updates continually add more issues that will also not be fixed. Many issues with loading up comments, images, videos. Links given to you by push notifications usually do not work and will brick the application, take you someplace entirely wrong, or just dump you on the home page. Lately, the most recent update causes some but not all comment sections to force you down into a singular thread with no way out.",2024-04-06 15:26:34,1
"This app is complete garbage. No customization options at all. Having to tap on a thumbnail to open a post, then having to tap on it again to open the image is absolutely stupid who the hell designed that. How is every update 3 steps back and no steps forward. Youtube only opens up if you tap a link from the subreddit but not the home page. How do you force 3rd party apps to shut down but don't learn anything about what they did right. Absolute trash developers.",2024-04-21 22:40:54,1
"While editing a post if I pull up my list of tabs on my phone, not even going to another app, just looking at the preview of what a different app was last showing, I lose my progress on my edit and have to go back to the post. This doesn't help when I'm looking at another tab to help with what I'm adding to my post. I have to type up what I want to say in notepad & copy & paste it onto Reddit. I shouldn't have to do all this and didn't use to have to. Also have 2 phantom message notifications.",2024-04-25 04:25:41,1
"Don't know what recently happened, but I can't open the app to save my life without being confronted with ""do you wish to close the app or wait further"" message, this ruins my expectations and my user experience, also, adding the right to left swipe should be a ability to enable or disable in the settings and not something that is forced on me, not a fan of it, not at all. Please update or fix before I delete my account and go touch grass while adulting!",2024-04-23 08:59:07,1
"This update is really bad. Most notably in the way swiping through photos in a post has become neverending, taking you to the next post without telling you, and also in how the download feature works now. Rather than quickly pressing download and moving on, downloading is more tedious and the pop-up covers the download button slowing down my ability to download pictures. This is a huge issue for me as I use this app to keep up with a Kpop group I like. Might wind up finding a different platform.",2024-04-20 12:51:25,2
"Reddit's own native app almost always has issues loading its own content. I have to actively avoid reloading the home page, because if I do, it shows as 'empty' and refuses to load any. Sometimes entering other's account pages glitches out as well. These two examples aren't the only glitches I experience daily. I am now going to search for an alternative reddit app because of how frustrating and inconvenient the experience is becoming. It is highly recommend that you look elsewhere as well.",2024-04-10 07:23:13,2
"It's pretty slow sometimes. Get a lot of errors. Also, this might not be the app but the site itself... the notifications always show I have one even though I've looked at all of them. Kinda drives me crazy. The site itself is also very addictive and forces you to engage a lot before posting on certain subs. I get that's a way to filter out bots/ trolls, but it means you're likely to get addicted. Not great. No wonder people try to ""karma farm.""",2024-04-22 20:43:48,2
"Each update is making the interface more and more intolerable to use. Things take longer to load as they search for what they think you want to see rather than allowing you to filter it yourself. I'm using reddit less and less these days as a result. One or the last social media sites I was using and they are throwing it out the window. Back to being productive again I guess, thanks!",2024-04-19 12:56:15,1
"A frustrating and intrusive necessity. The mobile browser version doesn't give you any real interface for chat messages, rich text editor, many buttons for optional linking/uploading, no flair interface, cannot important subreddit info, et cetera. The desktop layout has them but typing constantly screws up in that layout so it's completely unusable and wastes your time. Way to go, Spez, you made everything so terrible that we have to use your app at least some of the time.",2024-04-16 05:41:25,2
"This app is littered with ads all over the place, and now when scrolling through my feed it places in ""you might be interested in this"" suggestions that have nothing to do with what I'm subscribed to. Unfortunately, they force you to use it. It's low of features. Downloading images is a pain because they forced a pop up menu, that opens on the bottom. Not user friendly.",2024-03-27 13:52:07,1
"When minimizing comments, it now just snaps closed, no longer a fluid motion. I didn't do anything, is it automatically like this now?? Also, new ui for opening/closing posts is very clunky. To click on an image (in card mode) and have it open the post to I must click the image again for it to full screen. Not to mention the very weird minimization at the top of the post title and image/video where the video will be so small I can't tell what's happening yet it will still play w/ audio/visual.👎",2024-03-29 00:58:21,1
"Just about everything about this app is just a worse version of Reddit and all the previous apps. The home page alone is a disaster. Whatever algorithm they are using is beyond useless as the page is full of posts from subs I wasn't looking for, random suggestions, and ads disguised as normal posts. Media frequently fails to work, and it's hilarious how inept the app navigation controls are. I even tried waiting to see if Reddit would eventually care. I guess it's awful by intention.",2024-04-16 23:10:24,2
"Ever since they updated the video player last year, the app interface has steadily gotten more bloated and less user friendly. The sorting tab and page layout is different in different communities. The worst part is having forced ads play when autoplay is turned off. Always a loud video too. Obnoxious. Poorly designed tech takes away from legitimately helpful and interesting communities that people have built.",2024-04-19 17:18:41,1
"The app regularly refuses to load content into my home feed. I can close the app and re-open it, and I end up with ""Wow, such empty"". When I close and reopen the app. Same issue. Restarting the phone, same issue. Uninstalled app, reinstalled app, same issue. Sometimes I can pull down to refresh, maybe I'll get two or three posts. Sometimes it works. The issue usually starts the same way. I'll begin seeing only posts from one subreddit in my feed, then nothing. ""Wow, such empty.""",2024-04-10 03:18:08,1
"New update (04/20/24) has made the app virtually unusable. I try to collapse a comment and the thread gets auto's rolled to the top of the post. It auto refreshes when I was reading a post, so then I have to either look for it or not finish it. Very annoyed these issues keep returning with ""bug fix"" updates that just return the bugs.",2024-04-24 00:26:54,2
"After the recent update it is way too easy to accidentally swipe into a new post. Sometimes it happens when i click the comments button, like it thinks my finger made the slightest sideways move when i was really just tapping. Also, Caption text blocks the bottoms of images when open in full screen. Backing out of a post now takes multiple clicks, like more than is normally reasonable.",2024-04-19 19:11:12,2
"Latest update is confusing. The ui is worse than the previous one, and I can't send gifs or pictures through the chat feature. This needs to be fixed. There is also an unnecessary number of scammers that can get away with their crimes. I suggest sending a link that allows a user to secure their account and then activate a purge that will delete all accounts that were not secured.",2024-04-23 18:46:28,1
"Latest update added ""gestures"", which replaced already present gestures for absolutely no benefit. Congrats. All my my muscle memory for using your app is destroyed and I still dont want to scroll to some random vaguely related post that wasnt in the feed I was scrolling. Also it is extremely un clear when the swipe to ""keep seeing images in the gallery"" turns magically into ""swipe to an entire other post"". Excellent. Please undo this stupidity.",2024-04-02 12:03:32,1
"Clearly developed without any thought for tablet users. The natural orientation for tablets is landscape mode but this app insists on displaying in portrait mode. To use it you have to turn the tablet around. Not very practical for tablets that have a keyboard attached to the case like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra. Stick to using a browser, which renders this app pointless.",2024-04-07 16:04:20,1
"Overall, the app works fine and does the job well. However, it is riddled with weird bugs. Some posts, and mainly videos, do not load properly, requiring me to clear the cache occasionally. Sometimes, you can hear the audio of videos that are yet to be scrolled by, and they even overlap in certain situations (still faulty after many patches). Finally, it is an optimization mess and very laggy. I'd stick to the website if I could, but there is no proper way to use Reddit on the go.",2024-02-10 14:49:09,2
"Missing basic functionality like ability to change font size, this app is a visual mess with a ton of ads. I'm constantly misclicking because of the clutter. I hope you like ads! Did I mention the ads? Also the search feature is split up all over the place and doesn't return results that even Google can find. Also, it constantly throws pop-ups asking me to turn on notifications. Here's a hint: I'll never turn on notifications, STOP! Worst reddit app I've ever used.",2024-03-13 19:12:51,1
"The app is quite slow and doesn't cache data properly, leading to a multi GB install size. Manually going into app settings and deleting the app data is necessary after a few months to keep the app running at its normal slow speed. With the new update, the image options moved to the bottom of the screen, including the download button. This wouldn't be a huge deal if the pop-ups didn't appear in the same spot. Those can't be dismissed quickly and waste even more time in this sluggish app.",2024-03-16 07:58:10,1
"3rd and final review. App is back to being almost completely unusable. If I click on a post, it'll start freezing up and saying ""Reddit has stopped working"" with an option to wait or just close the app. If I click wait, it let's me scroll a little but then freezes right back up and the same notification pops up again so the cycle begins again and again. It's extremely disappointing. I used to really enjoy using this app and now I couldn't if I tried. Quit making it so much worse!",2024-03-27 06:57:21,1
I have no idea what images are part of a post and what aren't anymore. Double tap to like is an abomination and should be an option to turn off. The screen stays on if you are looking at the comments on a video. Clicking the thumbnail of a post is inconsistent with how it opens. Clicking a comment to collapse it results in random gifs appearing. V2024.15.0,2024-04-18 14:45:01,1
"Reddit has changed the UI (AGAIN) and has made our memorized swipe gestures completely useless. It wasn't bad enough that they moved the context menus from the top to the bottom when looking at media, now no posts are separate when swiping in the expanded view - they're all just connected as if it was one large post. To top it off, now if the next 10 posts haven't pre-loaded if you've got a poor connection, you can't even open a context menu, you're just not allowed to. Now it's useless.",2024-03-22 13:49:18,1
"Edit 3/13/24. Stop messing with the UI and fix your bugs ffs. Fix your trash app. Edit: Stop changing the UI and start fixing the bugs. If you click on a post there's a 25% chance it will open, a 25% chance it opens a different post, a 25% chance I have to click it two or three more times, and a 25% chance it just straight up will not open. Oh, but you have the ads down to a T.",2024-03-14 01:10:31,1
"Every single time they update the app, the UI gets more worse. Ex: You used to download an image by hitting a button in the top right corner, and then hitting download in the same spot. Now, when you hit that button, the download button is on the opposite side of the screen. Why? Why do Reddit software engineers insist on 'fixing' things that aren't broken. They don't even give us the option to keep the UI the same, these updates have to be so someone can justify keeping their job. FIX. IT.",2024-02-16 04:56:41,1
"Reddit tanked third party apps because they're unable to make a good one for themselves. Edit: it's only gotten worse. I can't figure out how to view a custom feed after making it, there's no way to automatically filter out posts based on flair or based on keywords in the title, and the experience with the video player has only gotten worse over time. And it's still asking me to verify my email even though I have. Twice.",2024-03-19 04:07:02,1
"New post navigation is absolutely worthless. The app can't tell a vertical swipe from a horizontal one, and there is no inertia to the comments section divider, meaning you have to drag it all the way, 3""-4"", down to the bottom of the screen, instead of grabbing it and flicking it down with a gesture, like it used to be. This is bad ux design worthy of being an example in textbooks.",2024-02-18 11:28:52,2
"Clicking the post used to make sense. Now you either open the picture in a separate window, with a ""go to thread"" button that does not work, and swiping back to home doesn't work anymore. If you do succeed in seeing the text it opens with the ad right above the thread's top reply. Having to scroll up to see the content I wanted to see is annoying. I'm hoping this update is a fix to the problems that Reddit created for itself. This is getting absolutely ridiculous!",2024-03-19 20:11:33,1
"This app works fine until it doesn't. And wow, does it ""doesnt"" often. I am CONSTANTLY having trouble with videos in particular, from not being able to upload videos at all, to videos showing they are fully loaded then get stuck saying ""Upload Pending"" to the progress bar going to the end and then starting comletely over endlessly. Among many other issues. Edit: I wasn't harsh enough; this app is literally terrible and if you're a content person, it is the most frustratingly buggy app ever.",2024-02-28 15:32:14,2
"After a few updates it runs terribly. The loading time takes forever. You can see the normal feed but if you want to see your notifications it's entirely hit or miss in my experience. This is a personal nitpick of mine, some may not be affected by it but, even when you do reach your notifications, it's not guaranteed it'll even respond to you reading through them. Maybe it's just an issue on my hardware, I have no idea.",2024-03-07 19:41:53,1
Ads are displayed inline with posts making it very hard to determine what is an ad and what is user content. Videos fail to load about 50% of the time. Not worth using. Also random ad audio starts playing when opening some posts. It's one of the worst apps I've used in a long time. Really appreciate reddit killing all the third party apps that actually made their product usable. 🤦🏻‍♂️,2024-03-12 21:21:36,1
"They cannot get this app right. Constant video playback issues, yet their ads on your feed load perfectly. When you go to watch a video, the app will play the last video you viewed often times. In the newest update they made it so you can scroll into the comments on posts from viewing them, but if a poster puts on captions on individual photos, and you click 'More' to view the entire caption, there is no way for you to view it. In terms of simple functionality, this app does leave alot desired.",2024-03-15 09:01:47,1
"Edit 3/14: Edited to reduce it 1 star because 0 stars isn't an option. This app is virtually unusable at this point. It still won't load posts when the page is refreshed. I can't continuously scroll through posts as it reaches an ""endpoint"". Then refreshing the page results in ""wow, such empty"". Cycle repeats. I've only used this app for 29 days and it was great at first but now it's so buggy I can hardly use it. It takes forever to load and then shows a blank page where the post should be.",2024-03-14 18:18:17,1
"This ""gestures"" update is awful. You're supposed to swipe up from the bottom to get to the comments on a post, but if you have gesture navigation on in Android, you swipe up from the bottom to go back. So in the same gesture, Reddit's moving to a new page, and Android's receiving a ""back"" prompt, which undoes the action of opening the comments, which means if you open a picture in full screen you can't go back unless you tap it and tap the X, instead of using the device's universal ""back"" action",2024-03-20 11:48:49,1
"If possible, I'd give this app -10 stars. The app's performance is incredibly slow, making browsing through content a frustrating experience. Additionally, it's plagued with numerous bugs and glitches that significantly detract from user experience. It's disheartening to see that after pushing away talented third-party developers, the official app fails to deliver the quality one would expect.",2024-03-01 15:23:44,1
"New update is hell. Changed the UI and how it operates. Can't see text for individual photos in a post, just opens the comments if you try. Instead of not being able to swipe after you get to the last photo on a post it takes you to a random post. Changed how the videos are played from scrolling up and down to scrolling left and right, trying to scroll down opens comments. None of these very annoying features are optional.",2024-03-13 09:37:15,2
"Since being herded to this clunky app from the third party apps, the overall experience on Reddit has declined. The ads are designed to blend in and look like user posts, the app crashes frequently, to see comments on a video you have to open it and pause or mute it while reading the comments, same issue for going to the poster's page, and the issues go on and on. I know this is the real world and tech bros aren't going to reverse course and actually improve their services, but still, this sucks",2024-04-04 18:13:33,1
"Two things need to be fixed, the scrolling between multiple photos in posts is quite frustrating. Anytime I swipe to the side, I immediately go to the popular tab and can't select other photos unless my thumb is in a very particular place on the screen. Next is notifications. I had to manually set each sub reddit I'm subscribed to to off instead of there being a Deselect All button. I only want messages and chats. You're getting better but vast improvement is still needed.",2024-04-06 18:20:42,1
"It's not total garbage but pretty much sucks compared to the many 3rd party apps they killed. Unfortunately it's also mandatory if you want to see anything tagged NSFW so you might as well install it. Among the things most lacking is the ability to format contents. You have to use markup for everything links. It also likes to collapse comments when you have your finger on the screen slowly scrolling or when tapping links. In other words, it fails at what is essentially the heart of Reddit.",2024-04-04 08:14:03,3
"Audio from 3-4 posts down start playing while you're scrolling, videos are in an awful format, and sometimes the audio keeps playing even after you start reading the comments of an unrelated post. Full size images are cut off in the post so the only way to see an image is by tapping it to open in a new window. Awful optimization and lack of intuitive UI and the only good thing I can say about it from a user standpoint is the tapping to minimize comment chains. EDIT: Still the same issues.",2024-02-10 01:16:48,1
"there are lot of opinions on the Reddit app. this is my opinion on the newest update. it is super annoying when I am looking at a post with multiple pictures, and I get to the end without knowing it is the last picture. then I swipe one more time and it is a totally different post and I didn't even realize it. that's dumb and a mistake to have as a ""feature""",2024-04-17 04:25:45,2
"The new UI that was just implemented is genuinely so horrible that I'm contemplating leaving reddit entirely. If I try clicking on a post that has any kind of media attached to it, it sends me all the way down to the comments and I have to scroll all the way back up to try and read the post. Swiping right on pictures will send you to an entirely new post now. Just horrible all around and completely unnecessary. The old UI worked fine, there was no reason to change it.",2024-02-18 18:22:57,1
"Accessing Reddit through a browser may be better at this point. Tapping something hides a comment, which is a great way to lose your place, while tap and hold brings up a set of share options that covers the majority of the screen. Currently the worst offender in Android is that audio starts playing for posts or videos that are not even on screen. Be ready for a bevy of random voices and sounds while scrolling, some of which seem to continue even after switching apps.",2024-02-12 15:46:54,2
"I'm sick of seeing ads that I can't opt out of. The ""He Gets Us"" ads for example are so annoying and unlike any of the Meta apps or TikTok, Reddit doesn't let you choose to stop showing certains ads. Edit: Now I have ANOTHER issue where the Call of Duty ad keeps playing with audio on. No other video does this and I have no way to hide the ad. No way to report the issue either. After getting a response from the developer, I am still getting the same ads. Has even ramped up since the Superbowl.",2024-02-15 12:11:46,1
"Horrible app, so many glitches and the video player is terrible. When tapping ""read more"" for captions on photos, it doesn't show the whole caption but pulls up comments.

"Terrible interface in app when using tablets or ipads. I like to use my tablet in landscape mode with a keyboard. I used to use the website, but they constantly nag you to download the app. Every single page I go to, it has the prompt ""Do you want the best experience, use the app or continue to website"". Of course since they make it nearly impossible to use the website I download the app. Guess what it only works in portait mode. Best experience my butt, you guys need to fix the app for tablet!",2024-03-06 04:50:33,1

Too bad, adapting to human hands is too expensive. Do you want to listen to a video? Hit the tiny unmute button that works 50% of the time. Do you want to silence a video? Too bad that same mute button just takes you to the post and restarts the video. They killed third party apps. And why? Money.",2024-04-02 03:20:54,1
"What an awful update. I used to read posts throughout the day, always able to go back to the app and continue where I left off.

"Recent changes to the way the app's UI functions has become extremely infuriating to use. Scrolling and browsing is no longer intuitive and fluid, with constant resets and exits. Also there are so many ads now. Every 3rd post is an ad for something dumb. Since banning 3rd party apps, reposts are constant and you see the same content over and over. Gifs and videos no longer play when clicked, and some don't even play at all. Whoever has been behind these UI changes should reconsider their job.",2024-02-13 18:18:44,2
"I rarely, if ever, write reviews. But this app sucks so hard. It's slow, pictures, gifs, and videos take forever to load. It's full of ads everywhere.

So absurd and ridiculous they started charging third party developers and can't even provide a useful alternative.",2024-03-07 21:40:12,1
"App is horribly optimized, it sucks down battery power on my Pixel 6 Pro at the rate of almost 1% per minute of screen time while simultaneously causing the battery to overheat, all while I've got the phone set to the lowest screen brightness. And the performance is actually getting worse over time, prior to Reddit's API changes back in July 2023 I could browse for 15 minutes before the battery would go down 1%.",2024-04-11 19:11:53,1
"App is clumsy, clunky and riddled with reminders to turn on notifications. Sorting your home page is no longer possible. With the removal of the superior third party apps, this one is practically unusable. Would not reccomed, especially since further updates have been a detriment to the app, even after the company went public",2024-04-06 04:00:06,1
"I think they just like making the app worse over time? The new gestures are dumb. You tap on a picture/post, swipe up for comments, then swipe back..for it to just show the picture/post, swipe back a 2nd time to be back on the post that shows the comments below the picture anyway, then swipe back a 3rd time to go to the main page.

But the new video play is the same thing but more annoying to use. It still loads slow and I have to click on it to see the full. 2024 / App has only gotten worse, and they have tried to block 3rd party apps. I still use a third party app. Reddit you're one of the worst social media apps out right now, good job.",2024-03-08 00:07:30,1
"It's a decent app but there's a feature that ruins it for me. On Android, if you visit the app through a Google link, then hit back on your device, instead of going back to the search results, the app just takes you back through all the reddit pages you previously had open. This makes browsing Google pages really annoying, I may delete so I can go back to normal web browsing, but they have made that difficult too. Why is there no good way to do this?",2024-03-04 18:01:58,2
The removal of the ability to sort posts on the home page makes the app much harder to navigate through my content. And not the ability to change this in settings has also been removed. It is not possible to click on cross posts with a video as the video plays in the new player instead of going to the original post. Ads also look identical to posts and don't clearly standout from user posted content. Swipe from the bottom actions for back don't work with the new message swipe action.,2024-04-20 16:53:16,2
"The new update is generally terrible, especially with the scrolling feature. You can't get through a series of photos without it jumping to another page.

"I downloaded this app 4 years ago and the ui was fine, minor issues but only in places that didn't matter so much. Now the ui is constantly changed and it's hard to use the app as the buttons are thrown all over the place. Video player was broked for a year until they fixed it, then broke it, and i had to redownload the app to fix it. The image viewer was the only thing that stayed consistent, Now with a recent update, it's all over the place like the video player.",2024-03-20 20:15:24,1
"Bloated, and feels like a social media app instead of a forum board, which is extremely off-putting. It's like Reddit rebranded and stopped wanting to be what made it great. If I didn't know better I would say that something happened in the past few years that forced a pivot to become like Facebook or something. All the 3rd party applications were amazing.",2024-04-01 07:42:50,1
"I've been on Reddit for 8 years, and have saved this review for as long as i could, but the app keeps bugging me so here. This app is awful. Can't block advertisers, can't hide ads, (despite reporting, blocking/hiding ads multiple times, those options are useless) constant bugs and glitches making the app borderline useless. Video player is still broken and doesn't work most of the time. Advertisers somehow tracking my location evem though i didn't give the app permission to track it.",2024-03-27 12:09:41,1
"Update: Now the first comment disappears when opening a post... This app needs a more consistent way of getting to the home page. Hitting back takes you to the last page but after opening a bunch of pages via links, I've been in back button hell for over a minute and still haven't gotten to the home page. Also, stop asking me to turn on sub notifications. I just want to use this app without distractions.",2024-03-18 11:52:31,1
"Forced to download for anything added that could be mature or NSFW. So, any martial art, fighting, accident, etc. Honestly, it glitches all the time and is irritating because sometimes you just want to open up a tab for later.

"New update! Zooming is now broken, and swiping between pictures has nothing to do with your scrolling! Wow! This app is so bad. There are so any features missing that everyone should be able to do. Friends list? Remove ads permanently? So much promoted content distracting from browsing. It forgets where you were. Settings are missing 'hide seen posts.' how can I easily view r/friends? There were apps that were wonderful to view reddit. Reddit app was never one of them.",2024-03-17 03:44:18,1
"Not even close to 3rd party alternatives. Slow loading, broken videos, and so so many ads. I see they want to force us to use this mess of an app. Edit: 28FEB24 this app is even worse now. Giphy integration doesn't load at all even after clearing cache and reinstalling the app. Also selecting a comment to minimize will randomly load into a gif file that wasn't even near the comment. Just terrible all the way around. I can't believe this is a publicly traded company, what a joke!",2024-02-28 05:42:06,1
"The newest update sucks! I hate that I click in a multi-picture post to see the pictures. And when you swipe past the final picture, you're now on a new post with those pictures. Whose bright idea was that? And seeing the picture captions are horrendous and most of the time unreadable as the ""more..."" is directly on top of it.",2024-03-20 05:43:42,1
What a miserable app. Should have left it to the 3rd parties since this can't function smoothly and efficently. Now in a typical thread you have to manually load more than the top comment. It's a mess. Between that and the way the video player/pictures function. It's like the designers don't even use the app that they put together.,2024-03-21 21:53:57,1
"The app bearly functions post will open on a delay clicking on a sub will just open an ad post, videos just won't load there's so much just wrong with this app I can't even list it all. To add to my review sometimes while reading comments it acts as though I've tapped on a new post just to show me a single comment when I just touch the screen trying to scroll through the replies. And the new way to view photos is unintuitive and being able to scroll over to a new post is just bad design.",2024-03-23 08:51:44,1
"(update). Still leaving at 1. The stuttering gone but navigating still sucks. Reddit on mobile browser better at this point. New bug of getting audio of post above post I'm reading comments of. Trying to give this an honest try but it's just not as good as RIF was. Not as intuitive, can't block certain subreddits from all, I get a stutter if I scroll to fast, it keeps asking to push notifications (no means no Reddit), and unless I missed something, only portrait mode, no land scape.",2024-02-18 01:43:04,1
This app randomly rapidly scrolls the page all the way to the top of the post. It's still a problem in 03/06/24.... Tapping anywhere within the app makes the page jump around. It's annoying.... Please fix this bug! The app is so hard to use now...Touching anywhere on a post scrolls the page all the way to the top. How do I give 0 stars or half of one star? The app is so miserable to use. The page randomly jumps to the top no matter what I do. Is there a way to turn this off?,2024-03-06 23:45:51,1
"Absolute garbage. Can't log in even if I wanted to, chats go to the wrong people, clicking anywhere on the screen may just send you somewhere completely random. A pathetic excuse for an official app, if you're going to force everyone to use it then at least make it work. I could probably make a better app alone. Uninstalling for good and never coming back except maybe on desktop.",2024-03-11 21:45:09,1
"Why would you change the app UI before trying to go public and introduce new bugs. Top comments disappear, the app closes or won't open, videos are buggy. What was wrong with the previous scrolling direction?? Now you have to scroll horizontally, which IS NOT intuitive and run into problems of confusing image posts with multiple photos with the next post. You should have allowed 3rd party apps cuz I'm about done with Reddit. Someone please make an alternative I can jump too. Plleeeaaase",2024-03-19 12:30:01,1
"This app has gotten progressively worse ever since the banned 3rd party apps, ads will start playing even when they aren't on your screen or anywhere you can find, if you touch an album on your feed and then try and swipe through it you have to swipe from the exact part of the screen that it wants or instead of staying within the album it'll just start flipping through posts in that reddit completely unrelated to what you opened. Also won't notify you about reddits that you specifically followed",2024-02-11 13:23:12,1
"App sucks. No way to change font size without changing it on your phone. Half the time when I collapse a comment it scrolls all the way to the top of the post. That and other minor bugs. Just a pain compared to the other third party apps they basically shut down. I mostly use other types of social media now. It's mostly due to the app not working right. Also, the big problem with racism on their site.",2024-02-27 01:48:51,2
"This update is hot garbage, the new gestures are very annoying. Swipping left is the same way to get to the next post as to view the next image thats in a post with multiple images making you just not realize you went to a different post. Swipping up causes you to view comments which makes you have to swipe down to be able to exit any media post but I have to drag my thumb so far to exit it that it becomes uncomfortable. And they moved the download button so far that I cant do it with one hand.",2024-03-21 06:56:12,1
"The app isn't working and hasn't been for at least a day. That might not be a big deal except Reddit has made it impossible for any other apps to connect to their site without paying a fee. They have also made it impossible to run the mobile version without opening the app unless you uninstall it, because it will open any link through the app, which isn't working. So any time the app is down, like now, the site is inoperable without uninstalling first. Just another way the website is dying.",2024-03-23 19:06:15,1
"This app is completely broken for me since about 4 updates ago. I get email updates from Reddit and when I click on one it will launch the app but it just sits there with a black screen and never shows any content. Same exact thing when I simply launch the app from the icon. Just sits there with a blank black screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared the cache and everything else I can think of but it does nothing.",2024-02-15 01:22:30,1
"Limited options for basic functions like making the display text bigger for accessibility (you have to change your SYSTEM settings to make the text bigger..... assinine). RedditIsFun was better in every way.

Top level comments are now disappearing randomly (but their replies aren't, literally just the top level comments) when people reply to me it shows up as double posts but only when I click on the notification from tbe notification screen, posts are disappearing from my home screen...just a few of the issues I've seen since the March 7th update.",2024-03-10 07:46:36,1
New UI is dog water. Every post I click on sends me to the comments not the post. Swiping will lead to completely different posts. Clicking on things sometimes gives me what is next to it. Contarant phantom clicks make me open the wrong thing or even worse ads. It must be intentional since they want the click revenue. This app is so horrificly atrocious and they should be ashamed. Bring back third parties the incompetence is too much. Edit: it literally gets worse every update.,2024-03-15 20:19:56,1
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. It will send you 10+ notifications a day about posts in subreddits you don't even subscribe to, and the only way to turn them off is to scroll through an absurdly long list of subreddits and turn them off one by one. Absolutely invasive and terrible spam. Usability is very very low at the moment. These endless push notifications can often be (in my opinion) inappropriate and upsetting material. Very bad ethically. Edit: still getting pushes after disabling!",2024-03-04 02:54:16,1
"Please stop trying to update the app to make it more ""cool and futuristic/ cutting edge"" every single time it back fires and a bunch of things that worked just fine go haywire.

"Buggy. Confusing layout. The new video player doesnt work. Load times are getting worse and worse. Viewing posts often redirects to a webpage for some reason, comments are now difficult to navigate and scrunched to a small part of the screen.

"Would rate lower if possible. I don't know how it's possible to make such an unstable, buggy, unintuitive app for a social network, it sucks. It constantly stutters despite having a good phone, it plays audios for videos that aren't even on my screen, it finds a way to make comment scrolling a choppy, buggy mess. This app sucks. I'd honestly download a lite version with less features immediately, maybe that would be more usable.",2024-02-06 23:10:14,1
"It's serviceable for Reddit content, however the bugs on Android make it almost unusable. It reloads the feed any time you switch away from the app and when you change the default comment sort, it reverts back to ""Best"" every single time it reloads. Which is a lot. Also, if you open a post next to an ad, it'll auto play the ad audio anyway. Bring back Reddit is Fun and Apollo. They knew how to make an app that isn't dog water.",2024-01-27 14:47:17,1
"When the reddit redesign came along the app was actually pretty nice and a good way to scroll through posts. The updates have been taking steps in the wrong direction though, instead of fixing the incredibly slow and studdery video player they just keep pushing UI changes nobody asked for. They make some areas needlessly minimalistic, and others clocked with so much stuff on the screen. There's bugs that have been running rampant from a few years ago, but no, we need another UI change.",2024-01-29 06:38:07,1
Updating 1/29/24 - Still absolute hot garbage. Promoted fake ads every 4 posts. App refreshes itself every time you open it so you never pick up where you left off. Impossible to navigate. Messy. Bad features. Ads disguised as content. Reddit was loved for it's simplicity and ease of use. All of this extra garbage everywhere on screen just makes the experience so horrible. It's beyond comprehension how ANYONE can think this is a product worth forcing everyone to use. TRASH.,2024-01-29 20:12:29,1
"This app is being pushed as the only alternative to the browser version of the website, which is being ran into the dirt because ""advertisers."" Reddit's new web design and browser are trash. This app is garbage. The entire Reddit experience the last couple of years has been purely abhorrent. I don't want ads. I don't want your terrible video player. I want to be able to see the pictures I'm trying to load, not a tiny preview. Fire your UI and web designers.",2023-12-20 04:43:42,1
"The frequency of lost content is difficult to tolerate. I was writing a verbose comment and switched apps on my phone to copy/paste a URL into my comment and, when I went back to Reddit, it had deleted my comment and put me back on the home screen. It could have been because of an app update, but it goes to emphasize that our content is not prioritized. If I'm writing an email or a note in other apps, it's saving the state automatically as I type, which also makes it resilient. Not Reddit.",2024-01-07 08:44:52,2
"The experience had only been getting worse and worse, but now the app is completely unusable. I mean that literally, it freezes within seconds of starting up, I have to clear the data or reinstall it any time I want to view the front page for more than 10 seconds.

"The Reddit app struggles to function at a fundamental level far too often. It's one thing if you're just using it for browsing and recreation, it's another if you're attempting to use Reddit as a way of promoting a business. Features will stop working, or the app will crash entirely. The web app is very little help as well. Some basic features just don't exist on the web app, which forces you to limp through the mobile app, hoping it's in the mood to work.",2023-12-11 17:59:50,2
"Reddit is a fantastic platform, but this app makes browsing a frustration due to bugs. The two most frustrating things for me are videos not playing after browsing for several minutes and having to restart the app to fix that. Restarting make me lose my place.

"Missing the vast majority of features and customization that other Reddit apps offered. Ads are hidden throughout the frontpage and many of the ads are offensive, but there's no way to hide or block them. If you're looking for a healthy social media site, this isn't the one.

Devs have poor direction.",2023-11-21 22:49:43,1
"Latest version is awful for mobile app. The version where you could view the comments (hit down arrow) whilst still viewing the video worked really well.

It's now completely over-engineered and basically unusable.",2024-04-18 22:29:29,1
"A terrible experience. RiF worked so well. Using this app is torture. It's not very responsive at all. Moving from a lost back to a sub is clunky. The ""machine learning"" homepage is a mess. I just want to see posts that are hot from the subs I follow, but instead it's mostly new or low voted content. There are far too many promoted ad posts and they blend in too much with actual posts. If third party apps could get this right, you have no excuse not to be better.",2024-04-22 20:30:44,2
"It's always been a terrible app; randomly scrolling back to the top, audio playing from an annoying ad a page down while I've opened an actual vid to read the comments, vids refusing to play etc... but now it's full on broken. It took a dozen refreshes to get it rid of the ""something went wrong"" blank screen and even then I'm unable to fullscreen a pic or vid. This trash app just got so bad that I'm done with it. The coders behind this should be embarrassed. Uninstalling.",2024-04-22 20:56:24,1

I proceeded with other things, came back later to the page, but it immediately refreshed and I couldn't post my comment.

"Wonky app in my experience, never had issues like this with anything else. Scrolling down on your feed you will occasionally be sent back up to the top. Sometimes scrolling your feed stops working altogether. Sometimes scrolling throws the perspective randomly up and down along the feed. Wonky.

This happens across multiple device",2024-04-12 21:18:25,1

"Great content & platform, only mediocre app. Often forgets where I left off (without closing the app). Often clicking on Reddit links in the browser opens the app, but not the actual page within it. Also, it's very annoying that you have to click that ""back"" button a million times or close the app entirely to get back to the home screen after you've followed a few links or have used the search field several times. This is unnecessary and I'd expect a better solution here.",2024-04-16 04:48:07,2

Important features to control behavior, which you find in unnoficial apps, are also lacking. Other than that, it's a decent enough app. EDIT: Tested the new update, and the audio issue seems to be fixed.

Sure. Tapping back again will go back to the post... which will also shows the comments... like what??? Come on... did the developers seriously tested this and go ""yeap, this is a great idea""???",2024-04-21 10:36:32,2

"Another new development. Links stopped greying out after clicking them. I love having to read every title of every post every time I open a subreddit. So much fun for me! New development, reddit app randomly opens ad posts behind others. I'll click a reddit text link and hear an invisible ad. Thanks reddit, your app is unreasonably bad. (Why are big bright white bars being added to night mode? I have it on night mode for a reason. At least let me toggle them off!) This was fixed",2024-04-08 17:28:04,1
"This an inconsistent experience with few options, posts on the front page don't show who posted them, links open in the very bad internal browser, ads are not clearly differentiated from actual posts, search is very ineffective etc. Reddit has a strong community, but the app is horrible.

They write ""message failed to sent. Tap to retry again"" it's really annoying because I have friends and now I can't even write to them. They also increased my time there to 54years. I wasn't even there for a year. When you receive messages, they don't send notifications, you have to go and check yourself, and it's really annoying.",2024-04-07 16:35:44,1

But sure enough, it's my regular feed that's glitching.",2024-04-07 22:32:40,2
"Latest update adding swipe gestures is a joke. Makes it hard to tell if you are still viewing the same image gallery, or have suddenly jumped to a whole new post.

My reddit layout just randomly switched the background color to this god awful green color. And literally out of nowhere just randomly. I've gone thru every single option under settings but the appearance/layout settings must be tucked deep under like 15 different sub-menus. Idk how it's possible to take something that should be so easy and somehow make it complicated.

Download, save, and subscribe button should be in front face not inside some three dots menu, like tikTok has. 3. Instead of three dot button long press on any video or image the menu would be convenient. These are my three remarks. Another thing video gets downloaded twice or thrice sometimes.",2024-04-17 01:34:35,4

"Update 3: So difficult to leave feedback, even as signed in user. This app is bound to have bad UX. Update 2: Why does the back button scroll the page back to the top? I pressed it by accident. Update 1: Autoplay is not working at all. I have it set to wifi only. Update 0: Swiping multi-image post ends up swiping to different tabs. Image/videos do not load very frequently. Why even bother showing a post's comments when the post is deleted?",2024-02-27 20:23:07,1
"The interface is very basic and could have a more modern design to look like a social network, users could be encouraged to use real photos instead of avatars, especially in ads, since every 3 posts 1 ad appears and there is no possibility of not even hiding this rubbish, so it ends up being annoying to see. The layout of the publications could be better, especially those with images and videos and the app seems to try to be a little bit of everything, a big shot in the foot, in short, it's OK.",2024-02-21 08:35:29,3
New bug where the app now periodically decides to refresh/reset your view and take you to the top as you browse. Reddit has joined other apps in forcing mess and unwanted options onto users.

"Reddit became the more or less quick and relevant source of information compared to the Google's SEO pages. The information here has more value for me than any search engine. But search functionality itself is far from ideal on reddit. Also, the most annoying thing is that copying function is not permitted. It doesn't really stop from switching to other tools, you know. It just makes it more annoying",2024-04-19 07:25:16,4
"Unintuitive clunky app. So frustrating that reddit removed options for 3rd party apps but haven't made this one better. Swiping through image galleries on my home feed you have to be v delicate or be taken to the ""popular"" feed, which I don't use. Its constantly suggesting useless subs to me. I can't clear chat notifications however many times I open the relevant chat.

"The app looked good already okay. They rounded the corners of posts (looks bad) and now you don't immediately see who posted the thing, but after you click on it. The platform is about the people who post things, let the pictures stay normal and show us who posted it. Edit: Platform has gone to 💩. It has such hard time loading anything anymore. Edit: now when scrolling Pictures on a post, I accidentally end up on another post, because all the pictures are connected now and aren't their own post",2024-03-22 06:27:51,1
Up until recently I was just dealing with the usual issues that others have already stated. In the past month though the app is constantly crashing on me. I can scroll my home or All feed no problem but when I go into a subreddit it starts freezing then crashing (some more than others for some reason). I've noticed this happens the most when I try to read stories on r/BestofRedditorUpdates.

The only good things I would say this app has over the third party app I used, is that posts on the home section from subs I follow are more relevant. However, there are many cons with this app. There is barely any customisation like changing fonts, or individual sizes for text (Title, body and comments.)

"Every update makes it less and less functional, unless it's shoving an advertisement in your face. Features don't work even after selecting them several times, it constantly recommends subreddits even after explicitly saying ""not to see"" anymore, and it is overrun with bots and spam content in order to, you guessed it, shove more ads in your face.

Now, you can't even open the comment section on a video without having the video pop up. Then you have to fight to hit the comment button on the video itself, because of how small it is. This is just a new bug in a nest that is this app.",2024-04-08 23:40:20,1
"Honestly, reddit is entirely it's users and in that sense it is a great time. The app is absolute garbage. I don't want to see ""similar things"", if I cared I would follow that subreddit. When I do try to follow the different subreddits it freezes. Searching for something you want to see? Nah, ""try again later."" Dog water app.",2024-04-16 03:15:59,1
The app is so frustrating. My homepage has been stuck for days. It happens at least 4 times a week and none of the usual tricks fix it. I'm thinking of permanently deleting the app and switching back to other more reliable social media. Would definitely not recommend.,2024-04-15 12:36:06,3
Not a very good app. Designed to intentionally annoy the user with popups. Injects ads that look like content. Reddit used to be great when I could read it with whatever app I want. But now their pursuit of profit has ruined the experience.,2024-04-24 16:46:57,1

"The poor design in this app is years behind everyone else. There seems to be no clear technical or logical reason why such a basic text selection feature is absent from the official Reddit app. Now I'm constantly getting Reddit community doesn't exist errors in active Reddits.

This app constantly has issues with loading content and submitting posts. I don't understand how the ""official"" app can work and function so poorly while apps made by one guy on his free time functioned perfectly. This app is hot garbage and I wouldn't even use it if we were given a choice. There's a reason the reviews are so poor for this app.",2024-04-22 20:51:21,1

Progressively gotten worse and worse. I find this app has deteriorated over the years to a buggy slower than ever mess of being fed garbage. Home tab has now become infested with subreddits that I am not subscribed to or have any intention to do so. Why should I see stuff I'm not interested in or is outright offensive and purposely avoided since I began using the site nearly 12 years ago. Keep recommendations to the popular tab that is literally what it's for.,2024-04-18 07:28:56,1

Often, when I face a tech issue, want consumer advice, or need to know something about a topic, I ask the Reddit community in a specific group and it is usually helpful.

Mostly only 1 and 2 stars. It appears to be a horrible app like I recalled but way worse and not a single response from developers. That's ALWAYS a Red Flag for me. Now only 2.6! Overall, it's a disappointing app with no excuse to be so unevolved. If anything, it has devolved considerably, and the reviews prove it.",2024-04-19 23:00:11,2

It's always been full of the obscure and out there topics, that's what makes it so good. Also a hive of excellent interest and research groups. The only reason why I give the app 4 stars is that it's laggy and freezes. I also used to like the live streams during covid, but they seem to have gone now.",2024-04-18 13:55:49,4

"This review may be removed if the problem disappears. Reddit's ""new"" update that makes you swipe to the side instead of swiping vertically to watch the next video like literally every other platform makes going onto the app worse than every other app. I'm not gonna change my habits to be on this platform. Instead I'm just gonna go to another platform and enjoy myself.",2024-04-20 03:08:17,1

Trash app. Trash company. Used to be cool when I could use a 3rd party app that allowed me to customize the layout and avoid the garbage ads they force every 3rd tab. Used to be cool when the app didn't log me out every other time. Used to be cool with their old award system. Used to be cool before they hyper-focused on IPOing the company. Reddit sucks now.

This is a terrible app and instead of improving it Reddit removed all competition. It doesn't matter because they got away with it but please remember this was always the worst version of Reddit. Spez is scum. Edit: 6 months later and the app is just getting worse. It's so full of adds and unwanted features that half the time I click the wrong thing. I genuinely hope reddit fails as a company.,2024-04-04 13:00:50,1
"Expect the experience to get worse over time. It's already horrible, and they are working on making it unbearable for some reason. Suboptimal in every manner. Every feature of this app only sometimes works. The people making the decisions parents are most likely siblings, probably their grandparents too. A broken clock is supposed to be right twice a day. It's hard to get everything wrong every time without knowing the right way. They have to be doing this on purpose.",2024-04-04 16:22:03,1
Good app to explore different things. But the problem is I get mail when someone direct messages me (that's great but) when I select view mail\message on Gmail It doesn't take me to message it just takes me to the home screen of the app.,2024-04-05 01:55:11,3

Absolutely horrific. My account got banned without a warning or explanation after months of hard work to get a following and karma. I've been trying to contact them and restore my account but I've been absolutely ignored. Not even once I received an email back.

"Recently the comments are doing a strange thing where they only load the first couple comment threads then once you scroll past them it has ""show more"" and then they show up but not before refreshing your screen and making you need to scroll back again.

"If you enjoy a smooth scrolling, easy to use app which is rarely--if ever--buggy I cannot recommend this app. If, however, you want an app that feels like your swiping at a rubber band and drifts casually from bug to bug like a trash bag caught in the breeze, then you are in the right place!",2024-02-24 04:45:39,1
The amount of recommended subreddits is just annoying. It's literally every 2 posts from subs I've joined. I really don't mind the promoted posts at all. But recommending cringe content just because it's popular on my country is just annoying and unnecessary. It's ruined the app for me since I spend 3/4 of the time hiding posts and muting subs.,2024-04-12 17:30:18,1
"The official app doesn't hold a candle to any of the 3rd party apps that were available.

"Glaring UX issues: * Side scrolling for galleries AND feed switching is a bad idea. These are completely independent actions and need a different UX pattern. * Galleries take around 1s to open. Third party apps did this instantly. * Subs I muted appear again because ""I visited posts before"". Muting trumps that, just don't show it anymore. * Gallery previews use zoom to fill, should be zoom to _fit_. What good does half the picture do me in a preview??",2024-03-21 22:25:03,1
"Comments fail to load, often the top two are duplicates of each other until you upvote one of them then it sorts itself out. Probably. It's so hard to see if there are multiple pictures in a post, so either you miss the second picture or you slip to the next post. It's buggy as hell and far inferior to some of thr third party apps that they strangled out several months ago. I hate this app. Do better guys",2024-03-17 20:06:08,2

This app is trash, bring back sync.",2024-03-28 21:10:28,1
"The sound in most video posts cannot be heard while playing in the app, but the sound actually exists which can be heard when played in Chrome or any browser.

This problem has persisted for years but the moron developers never took the charge to correct it.",2024-03-25 22:56:51,1
"The big issue is that it doesn't let me scroll to the side on the homepage after about 10 to 20 posts and then when I try to back out of the app it sends me back to the top. So it's all the posts I've already managed to scroll through. I reinstalled and cleared the cache and it still sucks. Every time it's updated it still sucks, so I will continue to update this review with that date. 3/18/24.",2024-03-19 03:55:44,1

Honestly this app is almost unusable at this point and it gets worse and worse with every update it seems. The biggest frustration is knowing if it's going to work or not. Always seems like I'm getting errors on a daily basis while using the app. Talk about annoying. I will not be buying this stock if they decide to go public. Can't even get their app functionality working properly.,2024-03-29 19:09:46,1
"They banned third party apps so this is now the only option and it's so garbage. The app is super buggy - comments don't load correctly, load twice, or disappear when you scroll.

Every positive change gets undone, they never fix actual issues",2024-04-02 00:14:13,2
"This app sucks. Recommends you subreddits based upon having been there one single time, or having clicked on one type of post, for example, I don't enjoy TIFU-like content, but clicking on one gets me content from similar subreddits.

Terrible ongoing defects related to UI: videos auto play when selecting comment thread view, article/source URL not visible on posts, comment thread cut off at the bottom of the screen, links outside of reddit app don't open unless you have it selected in your mobile settings, links in general don't work (e.g., a link to a comment in a thread instead links to only the comment with no context in mobile).",2024-04-01 13:25:53,1
New swipe right feature to see more posts is a terrible design decision when you have an album of photos you're swiping through. Unless you pay attention to the number in the top right when there are multiple photos you'll just end up swiping into new posts. Latest update plays audio from videos about 10 posts down. And sometimes it gets stuck on. Edit: they fixed it.,2024-02-10 00:27:06,4
"Update 6: the app got worse, again. Half the time images don't load, and if you reply to a comment the page refreshes because lord knows why. The app will only load so many posts before you have to refresh, seems to be a connection issue with its bubblegummed together connection. Will randomly refresh for some reason. Losing where you were on your feed. App listens in on mic to force feed you subreddits related to topics you talk about. Horrible app, horrible company. Horrible CEO",2024-04-15 23:45:53,1
Invasive and buggy. Try to slide between multiple photos and it gets stuck 2/3 of the way across. Constant bugging suggestions about irrelevant communities. It's a pest of an app.,2024-04-18 07:43:40,1
In the last couple of months this app has degraded into something that is very hard and unpleasant to use. The content is not the issue. The images don't load and the videos take forever to load aswell. It feels like this app isn't maintained or cared about tbh. Which sucks because there is so much on reddit you can find anything you are interested in no matter who you are. All that content means nothing if your app is barely functioning.,2024-02-26 20:38:03,1
Why can't you put datasaver video mode on? why it is so hard to? Also ...Can you cut down some of your trackers please!!? Data hungry app doesn't even have a data saver option...any other API based 3rd party application is better.,2024-04-20 04:13:57,1
"Love reddit, but this app is terrible. The comments never load, even when there are clearly comments on posts, they'll never show up. Even refreshing and reloading reddit, even uninstalling and re-installing the app doesn't work. And I can't default to the web browser cause it wants me to only use the app. Real frustrating!

"Third party Reddit apps were so much better and I hardly even use reddit anymore now that I'm forced to use this garbage. Every single time I try to click on a post or sub-reddit, I have to click through a stupid warning that tells me it's NSFW and asks if I want to view it. There needs to be some way to turn off that obnoxious pop-up because it's incredibly infantilizing. I'm 100% positive no children will ever be using my phone, so why do I have to deal with this nuisance every time? Dumb",2024-04-19 08:18:05,1
"Somehow, the app gets worse and worse with each update. The version I used before developed the ""empty response from endpoint"" issue when trying to post a comment, meaning I would have to spam the comment button at least 5 or 6 times to actually post it.

App sucks. UI is terrible. Severly lacks accessibility features. Ads are deceptive and made to look like reddit posts. Home page and trending order makes no sense.

"Used a third-party Reddit app for about a decade before they closed it. Used this one for about 6-months now.

"It's crazy that the user experience gets worse every update and they literally just had to copy the handfuls of 3rd party apps that did every single thing better than the official one. Instead they forced everyone onto this garbage.

"Just because you effectively killed your competition it doesn't make you better by default. This is a garbage app through and through.

Lack of audio on video clips linked and now you can't even get to the source. Notification pop ups block buttons until it times out.

Reddit is a good platform but the bugs really need to be fixed. My main complaint is that it takes FOREVER for Reddit to load up and open to my feed.

I haven't signed into any of those accounts in that browser and have no intention of doing so, which limits interactions there.

Wondering if the updates are being tested at all? If you offer a broken app for this great community, why are you closing API? Others were doing a great job before... Terrible design. Terrible decision on making 3rd party API leave. Reddit is awesome but their app sucks! The 3rd party apps managed it way better.",2024-03-01 15:11:21,1

Downvoting and muting don't a tally remove subs or posts from appearing on r/all. They remove all competitors from the market mostly bc any random app developer could make a more user-friendly, functional app than them.

Guess I'll continue to stay away from reddit.",2024-04-18 03:06:32,1

It's a pretty poor app missing many quality of life features that third party apps had. It regularly fails to load subreddits or fails to load when asking it to do simple tasks like sorting by new posts. It constantly shoves tons of unrelated content in your face in a weak attempt at making you engage more with it.,2024-04-03 14:21:58,2
An awful UI redesign for both mobile and desktop users that they implemented before it was even finished. You don't even have the option to go with the previous layout that's fully functional.

I have turned it into reddit many times and can't seem to receive a reply back. They won't fix the issue.,2024-03-29 04:58:13,2
Why have any report system if it removes someone who ADDED YOU from your access on the app but keeps the message notification so now there is a permanent 1 chat notification always there unless you tap it so now it does not notify effectively when I get messages while browsing the app. It literally punishes usage and communication the longer you spend and more people you talk to on the app,2024-03-30 22:41:44,1
The app has push notifications that just open whatever you were reading last. No amount of back buttons or refreshes will bring up the post I am trying to see. Completely defeats the purpose.

Another update and still no landscape support. Loses browsing position often when coming back from other apps or posts.

"Suddenly stopped loading the app at all. ""Something went wrong"" is all I'd ever get. Cleared the cache, force stopped, reinstalled and no luck. Now it says ""failed to authenticate you"" when I try to log back in (including when Google tried to automatically log me in).",2024-03-19 10:46:30,1
"I love almost everything about reddit. I do feel a little sad when I genuinely need outside opinion on personalized situations but I can't post yet because I don't have enough points. So I lose interest. Therefore, not logging in so much, therefore not earning points. It's really my problem, but if you're someone who needs to have that two way interaction right away. this can be aggravating. From now on, I'm going to make a genuine effort to learn how to use this app.",2024-03-13 05:42:38,4
"RedditHandle: u/KonradFelixCyprianus This app is an absolutely incredible tool for anyone who loves diving into the depths of online communities and discussions. Its intuitive interface ensures that navigating through the myriad of topics is a breeze, making it easy to find your niche or explore new interests.

Utter trash. How is this even an acceptable official app? Why can't I just copy any text from comments and text posts??? I can copy a whole comment or the title of a text post but nothing else? The app stutters and loads images slowly. Also the author's name is not visible unless I open the post. There is no return to top button in the feed. Can't collapse a comment from a deleted user. The new gestures are terrible and unusable. Why do you disable my back button in videos???,2024-03-16 12:49:37,1
"I hate to say it, but the official app is so much worse than any of the third party apps ever were. Every time I try to hide posts from specific subs I get an error that something went wrong.

Although, it would be better, I think if it could warn me before telling me, AFTER, I have made concerted efforts at quite a thoughtful reply to many posts posed, be so whatever the subject matters are, and then says take a timeout, for y number of minutes.

It's a great app to browse around. But to try to post anything in any of the communities (that I tried) is an unbelievably complicated ritual riddled with rules and regulations. I'm all for rules an keeping things right. But WOW!! You can't post anything for sale until you've been on the roster for 90 days. Unless I'm reading things wrong.,2024-03-19 05:19:10,3
"It's by far the best social app. Not perfect any means: specifically, the reliance on volunteer mods and lack of moderation consistency across Reddits are both positive and negative. But still it's much better--intelligent, courteous, substantive, informative--than any of the bigger social platforms. Especially Twitter/X, which was never great but is now trash.",2024-03-08 16:05:35,4

My recommendation is if you choose to look up information about a topic, make sure there isnt misinformation that are precived to be true. Even when they're not. Just be careful and browse cautiously.",2024-03-21 15:54:44,4
"I've had Reddit downloaded for a really long time, but just this past year, I've started using it regularly. I found it a bit overwhelming at first, but now I'm pretty comfortable navigating around the app. One of the things I like the most is that there isn't much censorship on Reddit. We have so many sensitive people these days that you can't post anything.. without it being taken down or cxled by someone. So it's nice to have an app with little censorship 😉, hoping it stays this way 👍🏻!!",2024-03-22 16:32:45,4

"This new update is absolutely trash. Why make the video and pictures small when you open the comments? Maybe I want to look at the comments while actually watching the video? Maybe someone points something out and I want to get a closer look in the picture? And the swiping to go to another post is just stupid. I was scrolling through some pictures and suddenly they were completely irrelevant with no obvious ""hey, this is a different post!"" Absolutely garbage",2024-03-12 17:17:02,1
Terrible experience on the app. The only thing that keeps me using it is the community. Always some sort of bug and the video player is always freezing. They want to monetize this app but can't even make it half decent.,2024-03-12 12:04:24,1
"The website is still somewhat OK, but the new corporate rules are obnoxious. This mobile app kind of sucks, takes up too much space, and is slow and glitchy. Also, there is no landscape mode, and autofil doesn't work on the login screen.",2024-03-05 07:23:03,2
This app sucks. It has too many adds and has diverged from the original concept of ranked content to more algorithmic content with recommendations that are completely irrelevant to my interests.

Am i the only one having this issue?",2024-03-23 19:29:05,1
It works but the fact you can't open any links in a real browser and in an app is ridiculous (why do I have to watch YouTube ads when I have a premium account?). Android should make it a rule that's it's forbidden to restrict content to an internal browser and not let have the option to use the one we want. It might actually break privacy laws such as GDPR since there is no control on the internal one.,2024-02-10 14:02:27,3
"Its okay. Works most of the time, but please tell me: why do I get notifications for groups I muted? Why do I get a promoted thing that happened 3 days ago?

There are some other small things here and there that are annoying, but those are the big three. Please fix them.",2024-03-17 14:43:12,2

So many bugs. Custom feeds dont sort correctly. Swipe scrolling only works for 10 posts. My home feed only shows like 6 subreddits out of 100. Video player is awful. And this is what you get and have to deal with since reddit killed thirdparty apps. Developers are not fixing anything. Independent Thirdparty at-home developers created wonderful apps and maintained them well. Reddits TEAM of developers literally take a year to fix a tiny bug and 80 percent of the time they break something else.,2024-02-23 23:39:15,1

"Whenever I want to browse something or see something that's unreviewed or even slightly NSFW, they force me into installing this app every time. Why can't I just view it on the website, they don't do this for PC, as they don't have an app for that, so just because you have one for phone, shouldn't mean you force people into downloading it, when it's the same, or even worse than the website.",2024-03-27 03:14:40,1

Honestly I've found it a good alternative to other shortform media platforms since if you click on a video you can scroll. The algorithm could be better but the advantage of it being hands-off (ie terrible) is you mainly get videos from subreddits you've joined.,2024-03-23 01:26:56,4
"Pretty poor app. Any development work and updates are focused on harvesting data and money for reddit. It doesn't even support landscape mode. Given it's a media app, that's a significant drawback. It's buggier than it should be given how long it's been around.",2024-02-10 20:15:54,2

"Honestly, when I first heard of reddit, I didn't even know what it was, or that it existed. Then once I found articles and things that led me there and I started using it, it has become one of my daily driver apps.

This is largely because I am apprehensive about how the rating up votes and karma and demerits etc work. I find the system really confusing and yet not interesting enough to me to take the time to learn it well, so instead I just avoid REDDIT sometimes, even though a topic may be of interest.

The content is great. The app itself is abysmal...... it's so bad it's frustrating. It just keeps randomly scrolling back to the top after you've been browsing for 5 minutes or 2 hours(!)..... the button layout is horrible as well. Who puts the Home button in the lower left corner instead of the middle? That makes it really easy to hit it if you're scrolling with your left hand. Ugh.,2023-12-04 20:50:31,1

It might just not post, or post the same thing twice - you never know. The ads are so randomized you just wonder how they were shown to you. Plus they're styled just like regular content with just small markings that those are indeed ads. I don't recommend this app at all.",2024-01-11 15:16:08,1
"Heck. For years now, the infinite scroll feature (where you can just swipe between posts) had been bugging out *eventually*, but instead of fixing it, it's somehow gotten worse?

I have disabled Chrome since it doesn't work well on my phone and now all the links in posts open in the built in browser which is very broken and there is no way to copy the link to open it in other browsers.

"From bad to worse, it's SLOW. The app had issues loading content before. It used to take about 5 to 10 seconds for comments to display properly when opening any post. Now, it's the feed itself which has those issues. Videos need to buffer several times or don't load at all, GIFs and pictures may get stuck in a blank placeholder. As any social media platform, you guys want us to keep scrolling mindlessly, that's the whole point. Unfortunately, these problems are killing that purpose entirely.",2023-12-17 07:22:25,1

Gives access to the dumpster fire that is Reddit at your fingertips. You can expect to get random notifications about posts you don't care about on subreddits that you don't read.

Great for the channel I am on. But I have been banned from so many for reasons unknown or reasons that are made up.

Reddit has seemingly removed the ability for YouTube and X/Twitter links to open externally in their own apps. They now force you to look at them inside Reddit.

I actually really enjoyed the ability to swipe right to view other related posts and swipe up to view comments but it appears they removed that feature after adding it only like 3 weeks ago max other than that I dig reddit id say it still need some ways to make viewing posts when you search on mobile easier but overall its a solid app and social service,2024-04-16 06:09:25,3
The app's performance is degrading. It crashes/fails to load content too often. The loading speed is slow and unreliable.,2024-04-19 04:45:17,2
Way too many ads for an app that doesn't even keep your place when you close it or let you open multiple tabs. How exactly is this supposed to be better than viewing it in a regular web browser?,2024-04-07 21:01:04,2
"It took me a long time to warm up to it. For folks that are unfamiliar with Reddit, it's communication over the backyard fence, electronically. But, just because there is any subject in the world here, you have a chance to meet very interesting people, and the opportunity to waste an entire day by the time you look up and see But if you want to compare this to some NCIS show with seven seasons, here you have to read and push buttons which makes this an intellectual pleasure.",2024-04-13 00:24:24,5
"The app is alright. The interface and use is comfortable, however, there's a known problem with mods & general political leaning that causes the rules of the app & website to be enforced unevenly. I hope things change in the future, but overall do enjoy the experience 🙏🏼",2024-04-24 14:35:48,3
"Somehow the layout has made my home feed a clone of the popular feed. Now I don't even see the posts I want to see, just all suggestions based on what's popular. I went on the mobile browser and same thing. It works on the laptop, so I may just use that only.",2024-04-13 15:44:49,2
4/19 update: even with this update the biggest issue by far is still the battery consumption. On a new phone this app killed 25% of battery in 1 hour of browsing. Unacceptable. I've done all the adjustments on my end and it makes no difference.,2024-04-23 02:56:08,1
"Good app could be great. I would like the ability to block more accounts could you increase the limit from 2000 to 10,000 because I'm already at my limit. Oh and make it so I can create custom saved post in nameable slots such as funny cat videos or songs. Like that",2024-04-15 03:14:39,3
The amount of times I've swiped to the right to view the next image and it goes to a whole different category in a subreddit then it loses my place where I was in the previous category is insane. How did anyone at reddit think these gestures were a good idea,2024-04-21 07:13:14,1
Buggy and slow. Boost was better in every way. Would be nice to be able to switch to text only mode for train journeys,2024-04-15 11:04:47,1
They try to get you to download the app by showing you a fraction of the topic you want to read about a certain topic and when you finally just download it only to have the entire topic deleted. Why would it come up on Google and give you the little sample of it if ots completely gone in the first?,2024-04-07 20:01:19,1
"Cannot log in. I use the same username email and password to login from browser, they're work. But when I login from this app, I CANNOT, it always says either my username/email and password wrong.",2024-04-19 12:51:17,1

"Reddit App restricts content that show up in your feed. It sucks, but there is no other option since they stopped letting people use third party apps which were all better in every way.",2024-04-19 18:15:52,1
I wish I would have gotten on board with Reddit sooner. I am more of a lurker and a reader than I am a contributor. I have learned a great deal about the world we live in as well as modern-day society with all of its hidden rules and conduct. There's so many people that freely Express how they genuinely perceive things and make sure their story with honesty for the most part and that's what I like about Reddit. Everybody is fake for the most part in real life. But then they get online andbereal,2024-04-20 02:52:49,5
Can't open pictures from the normal menu. Swiping with out knowing where the post ends. Collapsing comments opens the browser for some damn GIF. Absolute trash,2024-04-19 06:41:42,1

Even to my own profile! WHY???",2024-04-06 06:54:13,2
"What a bad freaking app, takes a great and functional website and turns it into a slow, cumbersome, sometimes malfunctioning or broken app. Give us back our better options, like RIF. You guys can't make one to save your lives.",2024-02-29 05:09:58,1
"Lots of great info. Can be a pain to navigate at times. However, I do not like spending an hour trying to add a post or answer that I thought insightful and helpful only to have it auto-moded and kicked back because you do not have enough ""karma"".. That just plain sucks.",2024-03-19 18:15:50,4
"They cannot update this app without causing a million other issues it is so frustrating. Especially since they update it like every week, so every week it is crashing with weird bugs.",2024-03-18 22:12:36,1
Prefer to use Reddit in chrome specifically so I can browse with multiple tabs . Downloading the app hijacks all Reddit links in chrome to open in app with out option to choose/disable.. Unable to find in settings. Deleted app due to forced use and terrible user experience.,2024-03-15 10:35:03,1
"Besides overlords censoring content and making and enforcing arbitrary rules, and besides the app being completely buggy and inaccessable 1 to 2 days out of the week. Besides those 2 things this app is incredible. But only because of the people that contribute to the platform. IE. The people and the users themselves. Management and the way the app is run itself is absolute garbage.",2024-04-22 20:57:18,2
I'm not sure what happened but this app is terrible now. Constant glitches. Blurred images even when they are safe for work. Unintended scrolling and post-hopping. It's awful now. Help us understand how things can continuously get worse.,2024-02-29 15:23:26,1
"Edit: a year later, the refresh rate on this app is maddening. If you navigate away to another app and come back it refreshes, removing anything you were typing and reverting to the page you first opened. Chronic problem of not being able to upload photos to posts. Have tried on 3 different phones, still times out on the post button. Limited interactions, and the 'search' function sucks - both on the app and browser. Easier to find what I want on Reddit through Google than its own search bar.",2023-12-19 16:59:16,2
"The UI design of this app, such as videos minimizing yet still playing in comments and swiping into other posts from photos, is on a downhill trends. Pretty unhappy with these ""developments"" and definitely led to me using the app less",2024-04-16 15:48:55,2
"The community here is awesomely active! I am quite new here so I am overwhelmed. Can't believe I did not know about this much earlier. It has most information (specially as a fellow gamer, the details here are amazingly helpful) - hate to say but it could be better than ""Ggle"" in terms of usefulness when hunting for specific dets ;) I'm lovin' it!",2024-04-24 04:33:31,5
The new scrolling system is dumb. It is hard to go to the next post when the one you're in have many images. You have to scroll through all the images to get to the next post,2024-04-09 11:08:54,1
"After banning me, they insist I log-in automatically all the time whenever I happen to click on any reddit links. Both the vanilla desktop and vanilla app are slow, unresponsive and cluttered with ads. Masquerading ads as regular posts, too, which is scummy at least and predatory at worst. Don't bother unless your hobby and/or niche community is solely found on reddit.",2024-04-04 14:42:53,1
"The app seems to have some issues ""updating"" new sub information. And I could really do without the random ""you might like"" subs that pop up. If I were interested I'd do my own search on the subject matter.",2024-04-17 13:55:18,4
"Can't make a post, I upload the pictures I want to post, caption it, turn on the universal tag I need (flair options doesn't appear) but the post button doesn't get highlighted. On the website is worse cus I can make only text post, there's no option to add pictures",2024-04-09 19:59:12,1
Started using sometime ago because social media got to annoying. It became my one place to come see everything from news to just honest post by Reddit users. I like the feedback given by the user on any given topic. 🙂 It's also the best place to help get your mind off stressful things. Interesting postings at times.,2024-04-03 14:18:33,5
"Pretty decent platform , pick a subject and talk about it and/or add to someone else's comments. Does what it says on the tin. Could be little bit simpler to implement and create but overall not too bad .",2024-04-03 09:57:57,3

"The advertisements are getting seriously propagandistic, The advertising system is completely disgusting, it allows religious propaganda to be shown EVERYWHERE. I am talking about the HeGetsUS Ads. Update: The app is so garbage when it comes to performance that loading a simple post, or actually scrolling thru the Home Feed is making the phone start freezing up (High End Flagship Phone) The app is falling apart at the seams. The CEO of reddit is ruining their brand and their user base.",2024-04-05 06:38:32,1

So terrible. Why didnt they just buy reddit is fun or alienblue? This all is shockingly bad. Pay some developers so this thing actually works. It is painful to use. Gestures are unintuitive. Settings are terrible and confusing. Style and layout is garbage. I am shocked that an app this bad can even be made.,2024-04-05 03:36:33,1

"This app feels like it was designed by a rabid capitalist who has no clue about UI design. Unblockable ads every 3 posts that are indisguishable from normal content, a tendancy to crash without warning, and text is not highlightable. If I didn't know better I'd think it was malware. Edit. App is forced upon you if you try to use the website in a browser on mobile. Also the app is almost unusable if you use gesture navigation.",2023-12-14 17:05:54,1
"This app is the worst part of reddit. The UI design sucks, the app tends to crash / freeze often, posting is a gamble as when you click that button, you don't know if you posted twice or not at all.

Edit 3: It's pretty much unusable as about 90% of times the app shows an infinite loading screen or blackscreen on opening. Edit 2: Using r/place to regain popularity, but the api changes, bots, ads and bugs make the platform less and less attractive. Edit: Sometimes it doesn't load any posts, sometimes it crashes. Bugs keep appearing and getting fixed, so cool they fix stuff but also kinda introduce more bugs.",2023-12-05 18:33:10,1
The new update is messy. The screen freezes every time I scroll and have to wait a few seconds for it to move again at which point it starts all over again. After 5-10 minutes of this the app crashes.,2024-02-29 16:02:12,3

downloaded the app again after a year and somehow they have made it even worse. way too many ads and recommendations for subreddits in my area? no one wants that. I genuinely can't wait for reddit to die and the next digg or whatever to be created. reddit has taken only the bad things from Facebook and destroyed the good that was reddit.,2024-03-22 09:12:09,1

"Slight edit: Currently can't even log into the app anymore, just keep getting an error. Account is okay as I can log in on desktop. App's just abysmal, even when not compared to 3rd party apps it's just objectively bad. It runs sluggish and sometimes it just randomly decides to autoscroll. Tapping anywhere on a video except the pixel perfect comment icon will fullscreen it and ignore autoplay settings. Often it's genuinely hard to tell the difference between posts and ads. Overall just garbage.",2024-01-30 13:23:05,1
App constantly cycles to the top of posts when trying to interact with comments or if I have to close in the middle of reading a long post. Only reason I use it is they killed RIF through the API changes and I'm more sick of it every day.,2024-04-18 16:10:40,1

Very reliable app when seeking information on pretty much any subject. People can get tangled up in conflict rather than sharing their opinions yet the threads don't always follow suit which is refreshing. Recommendations are sent without pursuing so it's easier to navigate through the entangled forums. Would highly recommend!,2024-03-31 13:19:22,5
"Notifications never arrive at all and if for whatever reason they arrive, they arrive on the app but not on my phone and they're also being delayed. Everything in this app is so buggy.

No point in engaging on this mess if you don't get notified about anything at all.",2024-01-31 00:51:02,1
I've had this app for years now and every single update seems to mess it up that little bit more and more. Simple tasks like watching a video or collapsing comments should not be as hard as they are and consistently drive me mad. While all these issues have been popping up you have managed to update the UI about 9 times with literally no benefit to the user or addressing current issues. Seriously if it isn't broke don't fix it.,2023-11-08 07:58:25,1

The only safe social media site that exists. It's the most secure social media app because the way it's set up; you don't click links accidently while scrolling and get malware and have to factory reset all the time. I quit all my other social media apps because I kept clicking on malicious links while scrolling. Yours is still so I'm in control and and links have no web preview so they're easy to dodge. That's the best concept for cyber security! Kudos!🙌🏻,2024-03-28 01:26:14,5

"Swiping to the next photo in a post is literally 50/50. Half of the time it just swipes to the next tab over instead. Can't ""see more"" on individual photo descriptions, when you press see more it just opens the comments. Ads every 3-5 posts.",2024-03-24 20:31:33,1
Has an absolutely horrendous memory leak that causes the app to lag to the point of unusability after 15-20 minutes of use. It's been like this for months and I know other people have reported it. Will update review to 5 stars once it is fixed,2024-04-03 22:53:19,1
"Update: things seem to have improved as of 2/14/2024. Happy VD, Redditors! Ever since the update the app has become unstable. Also I have to exit out of every video. Videos don't play. Feed doesn't refresh even after I close the app and reopen it. I wish I could uninstall the latest update.",2024-02-14 22:33:05,5
"Tried to use this on my new galaxy s24 plus but it just says there is a connection issue every time the app opens. If you are going to prevent third parties from making app viewers, fix your own first. Terrible app",2024-03-21 18:33:30,1
"App sucks! Glitchy mess that is missing features! Whoever developed this should never get near an IDE or any lines of code again!!!! UPDATE: The reddit programming geniuses struck yet again! Now I'm logged out of all my accounts and I can't scroll through and see images properly... I'll say it slow so these developers can read... I F I T A I N T B R O K E D O N O T F I X I T!!!!!!, UPDATE2: MORE GLITCHES! Page randomly refreshed and I lost the thing I was looking at. UPDATE 3: it's even worse!!",2024-03-31 15:33:37,1
"Reddit is like public transportation; not everyone likes it, but everyone needs it, great for kids but completely unsafe for them, ads everywhere for every demographic but the actual people on the bus or train, slum of the community messing with people just trying to get through the day, images of naked people, music playing somewhere, and weird inside jokes that you literally had to be there to get. 5/7",2024-02-09 17:31:37,4
"So in my pixel phone, the app used to me smooth but in past 6 months, it feels like laggy and its stutter sometimes while scrolling and media loading time is much slower than other platform. I hope reddit team is working on it and soon they will fix it.",2024-03-19 22:11:07,3
"Unfortunately not as good as Reddit is Fun was, and not sure it can be. Too many UI changes that happen too often that confuse users with unnecessary and unused features.",2024-03-26 04:05:23,2
"App is just broken. Videos won't stop playing the audio even if your scrolled miles past them or have clicked on a completely different thread. Works fine on my browser, but on the app it takes ages for reddit to load.",2024-03-08 12:32:39,1
"so many ads and I hate how this app randomly inserts garbage recommendations into my feed. they are at best irrelevant and at worst actually horrific. Also, comments sections just don't load sometimes?? I miss my third party apps that Reddit destroyed. this app is so gross.",2024-04-21 00:38:01,1
Seems like the app developers keep changing the way you swipe to get to the next video again and again. It was back to up/down swipe for a while (which I like) and now it's sideways again! It's a third time they do this. I hate it. What's going on??,2024-03-20 08:32:38,1
"I'm deleting this app until it's actually usable. viewing posts takes either 5 or 10 minutes (I've actually counted), scrolling is a stuttering mess, posting comments takes about as much time as it takes for me to cook some ramen noodles, and just about everything you interact with is slow and unresponsive. I have to use a third party web app to use reddit properly, it's completely fine on desktop and different apps, but absolutely atrocious with the official app. Bye bye",2023-12-02 01:40:42,1
They got rid of third party apps and then released their own with less functionality. I would happily pay money to never have to use this app again. Every feature you ever wanted has been removed and replaced with a worse version.,2024-02-20 15:32:27,1
Thank you for adding the ability to increase text size outside of system default. For some reason the default system text is always smaller in the Reddit app than any of my other apps. This feature helps so much for what is mostly a text-based experience.,2024-03-14 11:46:41,5
"This app feels very sluggish to use and sometimes will lag despite my phone is perfectly fine using any other social media apps. Also, despite I deleted my post on Reddit, I still can see it on Google and Google Chrome. It feels like they weren't even try to delete the stuff I wanted it to. Speaking of deleting, I couldn't even remove or delete the notifications. The only way to ""remove"" it is to turn off which I rather not. Overall, this is a very unsatisfying app to use. So optimise Reddit ffs",2024-02-28 08:27:01,1
On my phone daily using this terrific app sometimes two hours per day. I would definitely miss it if it were to go away. Always something new and entertaining. I Love It!!!,2024-04-18 19:10:46,5
Recent updates have rendered this app useless. Can no longer use GIFs. Most infuriating is being notified of comment replies and not being able to actually see them in thread! Been on Reddit for years & slowly watching it turn into a dumpster fire.,2024-02-29 11:20:01,1
"I'm very frustrated because this app is giving a message stating; ""Your account has been permanently suspended for breaking the rules."" How is that possible when I've never used the app? I don't understand how my information can be used on this app in a way that would get me blocked but I haven't received any emails or texts about the problem. There's no way for me to start a new profile so I may remedy this problem. What do I need to do so I can create a new profile?",2024-03-10 19:44:33,1
It is a dream come true for readers. We not only get to connect with others and share our interests but we also get and give recs. It is also amazing for authors to self promote and rwacha world wide platform without any form of payment!! 💯💯,2024-04-21 05:44:02,5
Extremely buggy and user experience is terrible. Back gesture is not utilized properly and if you access a private post/community there is no way of exiting that message screen besides closing the app.,2024-02-26 07:18:19,1
"Bad enough that content sometimes doesn't load, and that for whatever reason all threads jump to top after clicking links, or just for fun, but curation has become impossible. Resetting my preferences after update was tiresome, but now I cannot mute subreddits, so my home feed is full of subs I have no interest in and often no ability to understand due to language differences, while burying the ones I want to see. Apparently, something went wrong. Every single time. Thanks.",2023-11-17 07:40:41,1
"They forced third party apps to close and their own app is a broken mess. Empty home screen constantly, may as well use through a browser",2024-04-14 13:08:45,1
"This app ruins the homepage experience with content ads and recommendations for subreddits you aren't subscribed to. Rather than having a curated front page, you have to view each subreddit individually, or be drowned in unwanted content filling up 90% of the screen. On the plus side this app has helped me reduce my time on reddit substantially, so there's that I guess.",2024-01-03 17:58:25,1
"The people that run reddit just seems to want it ran into the ground. This app has finally become unusable now that half of my home feed has random posts from all across the site. I can't view the post that I have joined thanks to this website forcing ragebait, boring, or flat-out disgusting posts into the one tolerable part of this platform.",2024-04-22 15:54:12,1
It amazes me how consistently you can make an app worse with every update for such a long time. It's at the point where after the last update the app simply doesn't load for me anymore. I genuinely don't understand how such a well established platform can be managed so incredibly poorly.,2024-02-15 20:12:37,1
"Truly one of the worst apps I've ever used. The features, ads, and layout all make for an unpleasant experience. This app gets worse with each update.",2024-02-11 01:50:33,1
"Very bad platform both in browsers and the App itself. Whenever I want to reply with a photo, it always says something went wrong and it doesn't post it. And in the browser, the option to insert an image attached to a comment is blocked by the Markdown Mode button. HORRIBLE AND UNFAIR!!! FIX THIS NOW OR ELSE MY CALIFICATION WILL BE SERIOUSLY BAD!!!!",2024-01-13 16:00:56,1
"Would be nice if I could filter out the YouTube posts, those are annoying. Videos often don't display at all. Other than that, great content. Ads aren't too annoying.",2024-02-23 04:46:14,4
Too many ads and promotions. Too much clutter and irritation things like 'because you've visited this before or shown interest or similar or popular near you' Reddit ain't worth the time ain't more. Forever have to spend time clicking on 'show fewer posts like this' .,2024-04-16 18:46:07,1

"Absolutely trashy, awful non existent code. Trash can app breaks down every couple of weeks and then they wonder why everyone still uses Reddit Is fun, boost and other work arounds to avoid this garbage. I wouldn't wipe my butt with this app. No point in remembering when this app worked somewhat decently 7 years ago. No point in remembering how pathetic this company is for trying to push this turd onto our phones",2024-02-12 11:53:04,1
"Can anybody explain why companies change the UI of perfectly functioning apps and make them worse for absolutely no reason? Great, now navigating pictures and videos is a total pain. Thanks for ruining half the purpose of the app.",2024-04-19 05:27:28,1
"Used to be great but videos never load, comments take forever to show up and overall has just gotten worse and slower over the past few updates. Top posts by week has also stopped working",2024-04-05 00:02:08,1

"The interface is confusing, features are half implemented (you can make custom feeds, cannot edit or delete them), notifications don't send, and everything is locked behind the app if it's more than PG rated. Terrible app, terrible company",2024-03-11 11:46:43,1
"This app is horrendous. Every other post is a sponsored post. The app also keeps shoving subreddits in my face I have no interest in. Then there is the video... My gawd, most can't play with sound, videos not on screen start playing and don't stop regardless of scrolling way down or opening a post. No wonder they forced 3rd parties out, those companies were actually making efficient products",2024-02-09 19:30:22,1
"Cant even load communities i was in before and just kicked me from most of them. Barely even works now. Also asked me to send in email variation, after i did it 3 times. I knew reddit was a cesspool but didnt think that the app would become one aswell.",2024-04-10 12:00:35,1

"The year is 2049. The reddit programmers still have not figured out how to implement landscape mode. However, the ads still scream just as loud as in 2024. Disgraceful... Stick to the website, people, with some decent browser that supports extensions.",2024-03-19 19:39:44,2
Though its a 5 Stars platform but I don't know it fully the reason my be myself but it's not easy to use and also the frequent appearance of sponsored links is very disturbing. Its my experience with the desktop I use mostly.,2024-04-18 16:27:15,4

Most buggy app I've ever seen. I just wanted to check the news. Can't read comments. Page jumps around while reading. Playing sound on a loop in the background. Uninstalling.,2024-02-28 13:45:51,1
"Trash app. If you want to go into comments of a video, it makes the video fullscreen instead (even if I carefully press the comment icon), Ads are disguised as posts, UI is garbage and there's useless things you can't get rid of in the home page (communities, chat (no one uses this), etc.) and a lot more issues that will not fit 500 characters in this review. I miss 3rd party apps.",2024-01-01 06:37:37,1

"Get your sh together and fix the app already. And also, stop forcing us to use the app when it doesnt work well. Website is much easier to use but you force us to use app. So annoying. I'd rather quit reddit. Do better.",2024-04-15 23:37:45,1
"updated from 3 stars to 4. No issues, app is good. Would like to be able to make font larger though! Old review: Been using the app for a year, no problem. Get on it today and it kicks me off every time I try to respond to a comment! I've uninstalled/reinstalled it twice to no avail.",2024-03-19 10:15:52,4
It preyed on my loneliness. The app features seemed addictive. Like points and such. A popularity contest. I was anxious sometimes to pick up my phone and see if anybody looked into me. It filled my head with negative imagery and thoughts. I wasn't taking care of my daily tasks. I wasn't brainstorming about something to do anymore. It turned into an addiction very quickly. Probably because I'm alone. Within two weeks I deleted it from my life. I'm relieved it's gone and now I can get on with it.,2024-02-22 17:32:13,1
"After breaking third party app support, the least they could do is maintain a functional app. Turns out even that was too much to ask. How users interact with content ranges from frustrating to broken. An image preview will display but when tapped either won't load or will take an inexcusable amount of time. This and so many other bugs make it a horrible experience.",2023-12-05 00:22:54,1
"You'd think the official client has to be one of the best, but no, this is one of the worst Reddit clients. You can't properly use new lines when writing a comment. You have to exit videos twice. You can't click the original in a crosspost. Ads with comments enabled don't let you view the comments without going to a nearby post and swiping. Update: 12. March 2024: Now the first comment of each thread won't load correctly, and every comment keeps jumping.",2024-03-12 18:58:34,1
Update almost a year later: somehow this app is EVEN WORSE than before??? Reddits IT team needs to be replaced. How is this app this old and still runs like trash? So much freezing and crashing there's no point in even trying to use it.,2024-03-07 19:21:09,1

Edit: pictures also doesn't load almost never, when clicking at them on post, as well as avatar cannot be seen, options about changing it - not loading at all. Reddit is just bad now. Also, can't post anything, it just loads and loads, after clicking ""post"".",2023-12-27 21:51:32,1

"I really don't know how it's possible to make an app worse with every update but Reddit manages just fine. The issue with the video player is never fixed, the app is laggy and unoptimized, and something always manages to go wrong. Fix your garbage if you're gonna force people to use it! EDIT: now even trying to leave a simple comment on a post crashes the app. Amazing.",2023-12-05 06:31:39,1
"I thought all the hate for this app was all just annoyance at a few poor corporate decisions. Then I downloaded the app. It's a genuinely horrible experience. Not much is intuitive and a vast majority of the functionality I hoped for from old 3rd party apps was gone. The ads are pervasive and hidden. The ""suggested content"" is I think chosen completely at random and the overall feel of this app is like being dragged by the lips through an unclean public toilet. Yuck. I miss Reddit is Fun.",2024-01-10 19:15:14,1
"Reddit is great, the app is a disgrace. Many missing features, and EXTREME stability issues, especially with the videoplayer. -Videos stopp buffering for no reason frequently -Videoplayer crashes occasionally(no way to pick back up where you left) - you will see new videos everytime but you will also see a couple of videos 5 times every day for half a year. I've unfollowed and blocked sites and people because if this.",2023-12-30 13:17:27,1

Terrible app. Each update creates more issues than it fixes. It's clear no one at Reddit actually uses this garbage app themselves with how many problems it has. Way too many problems to list in 500 characters.,2024-03-29 21:44:45,1
Settings don't save. Load times have increased. I set my default comment sorting to top and every post I open is sorted by best or new. Annoying to navigate with ads everywhere.,2024-03-29 19:45:49,1
It's quite terrible. The best part is when you press back and expect to be at the place you were but instead the page has completely refreshed and you're back at the top of the list. Dev team crushing it over there.,2024-03-29 04:26:16,1
Can't post a picture in comment. Picture turns into * . I have to use desktop PC to add picture in a comment. Reddit forced 3rd party apps out and can't make app that works. But the ad section works great.,2024-03-28 10:25:59,1
"Can't even read posts on this garbage app because there is no setting option to change the font size. My last app for Reddit didn't have this problem but that was before they went full nazi and shut down all 3rd party apps. I'm so done with this clown show anyway. How do you pay the CEO so many millions when the app has lost money every year? And all the content creators and mods get zero. I'm walking away, you should too.",2024-03-27 20:00:31,1

"Great app! You will find videos here that you won't find elsewhere. So far, they promote free speech, unlike YouTube, Facebook and all if the other apps that you can upload videos and posts. That makes Reddit and Rumble the two big ones for free speech. Crazy that I have to put that in a review in the USA!! But it's true! The other apps remove, ban, shadow-ban, censor. Reddit does NOT censor speech!!!!",2024-03-28 15:43:37,5

"Today is the day where I officially leave Reddit and leave my review after using it for so long. Let me just get it over with; There are numerous bugs on the app that haven't been fixed in forever. Accounts are randomly getting perma-banned with no appeal or reason (unfortunately it happened to me). The official Reddit dev team SUCKS 🍑. So if you have a problem, best to try and do it yourself, cause they ain't helping lol. Uninstalled and probably won't come back to it 👎",2024-03-05 15:57:37,1
"Despite being a loyal Reddit app user, the persistent issue with images is disheartening. The inability to view images fully within the feed has been a longstanding frustration. It's perplexing why this concern hasn't been addressed over time, as it significantly impacts the overall user experience. A resolution to this long-standing problem would greatly improve the app's usability and user satisfaction.",2023-11-30 08:50:53,1

You search in Google and you find answer on reddit. You press the link and get error. It forces you to log in. OK. After log in it asks you to open in the app. You press OK and then you get the main page and not what you were looking for. Reddit pop up ask if you enjoy the app. No I don't. It offer you to report the reason but lead you to search solutions. Are you kidding me?,2024-02-25 09:04:45,1
It okay on a high end phone I am using Samsung s series but it is abysmal on mid to low end devices like when I was using a Huawei mid range phone it was sluggish and had some issues here and there so it needs better optimisation in my opinion. That's y the three stars,2024-03-10 08:14:51,3
Why the hell is this app so unoptimized? This is so terribly made and always lag when I use it. At first it was perfectly okay until it just start not working anymore? What the hell?

"Generally, a very good experience, mostly a good community. The only frustrating part is when someone posts wrong, biased data with no sorce, and it gets upvoted because it was posted first, and below would be numerous factual data with reliable sources, but people are too lazy to go past one or two answers as the first answer got many upvotes. One of the way to deal with this would be to have something similar to community notes on X/Twitter, since then you wouldn't need to scroll down so much",2024-02-25 13:55:54,4

Ffs why TF did you guys change the gestures ? Are you trying to ruin everything thing you see ? Last month it was the video player and today I have to relearn scrolling videos in the app.. do you find pleasure in making things hard on people ? Why try to fix something that's not broken?,2024-03-12 01:29:35,1
Updates are making the app worse. First the top comment was being shown only the replies to itm now you can't scroll the videos. Instead it just opens the comment section. I have reinstalled and still the issue. This must be an issue with the last update,2024-03-11 19:15:01,1

Update Nov 2023: still can't follow links from Reddit properly. There was an Instagram link that was impossible for me to see. I couldn't copy the link because the functionality doesn't exist. I couldn't long press on a link to open it in a different app. Reddit really wants it's users to be completely captive when it doesn't even let you open links in your own browser. Hostile or incompetent? You decide,2023-11-26 07:32:44,1
Consistently buggy and unreliable. Keeps recommending me hate groups no matter how much I tell the app I don't want to see thesse groups. It's basically impossible to look up the news on controversial topics doesn't result in your feed getting flooded with Neo-Nazis and Tankies.

Originallly hid the ability to sort the home feed in the setting and then completely removed the feature so it is now only on the website instead of the app for some inconvenient reason. Also hid the sort comment option in the settings which now doesn't work and defaults to 'best' whenever the app is closed and opened again.

"Reddit has gone downhill since the elimination of Awards and third parties. I enjoy scrolling 'Popular', and when entering a thread and leaving, it auto-scrolls ALL THE WAY back to the top, and I have to spend unnecessary time scrolling back down to where I left off, and it's frustrated me enough to uninstall the app. Please don't leave a ""Thanks for your feedback, we try our best to improve yadda yadda yadda"" because this won't change, and we know it. Just... Go back to your old roots c. 2022!",2024-02-08 09:25:57,2
"I love Reddit, but loathe this app. A lot of settings and capabilities are stripped. NSFW pop ups every time you visit a profile or a subreddit labeled as such. Small buttons that can be closely bunched together and hard to press (touching a username to see their profile - in the comments, I end up collapsing the thread over half the time; when clicking OP's name shown under the community name, I end up visiting the community over half the time). No left vs right handed layout options. GimmeRIF.",2024-02-01 02:21:49,2
There's no reason not to have font size controls that are separate from the OS settings. The size of text in the OS is not indicative of the tiny text in this app. It's an accessibility issue that could be easily resolved.,2024-02-05 07:33:26,1
"Yo this is nothing but bugs. Got the app cuz the site wouldn't let me use Google to view stuff but it either fails miserably and won't open the images or it redirects me to the play store to download it even though I already have, and if I open from pay store bam back to Reddit home page. Not worth pushing an app that doesn't work so hard I can use my browser.",2024-02-03 15:03:38,1
Pics and videos don't load since weeks and i think this app is getting worse by day. Edit2: videos and pics still don't load and since a few days my comment Section sort will reset to 'best'.

2/24 update Still the worst version of reddit. Most of the 3 party apps worked better than the official reddit app. It still takes forever to load even Images and has way too many irrelevant ads. The ui is extremely clumsy and it's definitely brought down my use of the website. They made a huge mistake being greedy and destroying the 3 party market that made the platform usable.,2024-02-01 18:25:15,1
"Extremely disappointed with this app. It's literally, not figuratively, the worst 1st Party I've used for any platform. None of the UI makes sense from a design perspective with users in mind. The amount of bugs in this app is so frustrating that it is 100% the reason why I don't use reddit much anymore. It's obvious that Reddit can see all the negative comments and just doesn't care. I don't see user engagement doing anything but going down as they double down on their business practices.",2024-01-31 14:53:53,1
"I miss rif. Announcing my bias first. App is 'functional'. Have issues with collapsing comments or nested comments. Have issues with trying to get other apps to open from. Not quite sure, but finding a user profile or some content from user can be difficult. Modding for subreddits is possible, but limited. I know reddit needs to eat, so the ads, I get it. But I hate it. I use the website less and less. And that sucks, but maybe I am just moving on in general.",2024-01-29 23:37:35,2
This app is nothing like what I was use to. I use to use a third party app with tons of QoL features. Now most of the time I open a link to a video it just resets my page completely. Sure I still use it but like if this app is like a 3/20 every other social app is a -2/10. This app is comparable to the corn found it poop.,2024-03-20 04:20:23,1

1) Bring back up down scroll to go to next and previous post. the new right to left scrolling sucks.

Hot garbage. Reddit prompts us to get off of the reddit website and onto their app and then bans all other apps that make reddit a joy to use. We can't even change the size of text in the reddit app! A basic function like changing text size is not an option in this app. Trash! Do not install until they fix it. Use the website instead.,2024-02-07 17:28:24,1

So far I love it, so many different groups to join, always a good discussion to be found and every topic you could think of I'm sure of it. Reddit is awesome.

This app is so garbage. This is an edit: the gestures suck. I can't close out of the comment section by swiping down. It goes down and then comes back up.

Can't see who posted something on the front page. 4. Refresh doesn't go to the top. Too many bugs to list. I uninstalled.,2024-02-26 21:35:03,1
I guess it works... Most of the time. But it's too simple and you can barely customize anything. There were so many better options out there and now I can't use any of them without paying an absurd amount of money. Why does Reddit have to be so greedy these days? Edit: something that annoys the heck outta me. it's not possible to save an image from a comment. I just end up hiding the comment. Why? Every other decent reddit client let me save em. Also the app is becoming buggier and buggier...,2024-01-27 22:56:29,2

We can't use the Fancy Editor or save drafts on the app. I set Comments to be listed from Newest to Oldest, the app keeps resetting them to ""Best"" first. Explain why we need this app.",2024-02-06 04:31:09,1
"App does not work very well , preferred using RIF which no longer exists, it was much much much more user friendly. I stopped using reddit altogether in June 2022 and have recently started up again but the app is just as trash as it has been for years. All reddit users want is a more user friendly app to that point we used Apollo and RIF but you just for real will not listen and that in itself really bugs me",2024-01-28 18:52:03,1
"App is officially bricked on newer Androids. I have an S24, and there is a current breaking bug that will not authenticate any of my Reddit accounts randomly.

"New year new review. Latest update means that clicking on a pic to idk read it now means I have to back out twice to get back to my main feed. Collapsing comments to expand a video works very poorly, with the comments frequently springing back despite the video being fully expanded. I'm honestly so annoyed at the extra swipes to get back to my main feed, what a backwards UI decision when the previous method was effective.

I will say the post karma needs to amount quicker not just the comment karma, it makes it hard to make posts and gain karma as slow as it is.

The stupid bounding snoo face while the app struggles or fails to load anything is the most annoying change yet. This app sucks. They killed third party app access and we're left with this trash. Garbage app. Garbage admin running it. The top post in every subreddit is an ad. They hide ads to look like user-submitted links. The worst option for browsing reddit. Even using a mobile web browser is better than this trash app.,2024-01-26 17:32:04,1

"So Reddit banned all the good third party apps so they could make more ad money pushing this garbage trash? Unusable, and inserting a sportsbook ad every scroll somehow isn't the worst part.

Terrible performance and design all around. Almost every third party app was designed better before they got greedy and forced users to use their version. Stay away from this dying company.,2024-03-05 00:06:29,1

"I'm having a hard reading the small text on this app. Apparently there is a way to make the text larger on the iOS version, so I guess it's another one of those mornings eff android scenarios.

Reddit is awesome. It helped with my depression. When I was in a really dark place I would go to subreddits of successful and happy people to understand what I was doing wrong. I would read through them and realize that other people were people too and I wasn't this one off depressed idiot.

App is absolutely terrible compared to the 3rd party readers that reddit killed. Way to many ads and features that just plain don't work.,2024-02-18 12:27:53,1
I really enjoy Reddit. I find a lot of useful information on there. People interact with each other and pass useful information on to each other.,2024-03-08 20:58:26,5
App keeps refreshing on its own. Have fun trying to read anything when it keeps constantly refreshing.,2024-03-21 20:51:56,1

Pretty good place to find interesting stuff. Not a good app for discussions your censored heavily by mods who are heavily biased. Additionally it's the same mods running the most popular sub Reddit's. SO my advice is look but do not engage,2024-02-16 18:02:15,1

I mean it’s reddit. Once you teach it what you’re into it’s a great way to get your news and information. And if you need to see some funky or funny stuff hahaha Quiet helpful that they ask you on signup what you’re into so you don’t have to start from scratch. Just a bit cluttered,2024-03-14 10:21:19,4
Open a link elsewhere and when you want to view it in the app it just takes you to your front page and not the thread itself. Good fken work,2024-03-15 07:26:23,1
Thanks for updating the Reddit app! We've updated our Android app with bugs and changes to degrade your overall experience.,2024-03-06 20:35:06,1
I love that I can get information about just about anything and that it's pretty legit. I only put 4 stars because of how nasty people can be to one another for no reason. I feel like there should be some kind of safe guards against meanness.,2024-03-11 19:35:13,4
It's not updating private messages. It's saying I have a message from someone but it's not showing the message. Please fix,2024-02-21 17:53:26,2

The swipe over update is so annoying. I'm trying to swipe on pictures and it puts me in the popular section of the app.,2024-03-14 17:32:14,2
Absolute garbage app. Forced to use it on my mobile due to reddit restrictions on their API to 3rd party apps. RIP RIF is fun. Edit: app is still a POS. Images and videos take forever to load. Why force people to use such a piece of trash?,2024-02-18 04:04:53,1

I don't know why but my account was banned for no reason. I tried figuring why and sent a message to them but couldn't get a response. It's been like this for several months now. They should kindly attend to this issue.,2024-02-16 08:37:02,2

Crashes often. Loses track of what post you are on even more. Will play videos in the background of posts you were on a while ago when the app starts preparing itself for its imminent crash. I cannot believe the difference between the official app and the 3rd party apps Reddit killed. RIF was so much better.,2024-01-16 21:17:14,1

It's bad when compared to even the worst 3rd party ap but not as bad as everyone is making out. Solid 2 stars. Edit 1 star. This app chews through data caps. Blew through 10gb in a week and I'm not even on it that much. Looking into it it's the fault of the app where it downloads all the different res of a video.,2024-01-12 00:33:13,1
"Constantly crashes, especially when clicking to add a comment. Just refuses to load some posts. You'd think that, given they've effectively forced 3rd party apps out of business, they would have made sure their own app works first, but apparently not. Not blaming the engineers - they're clearly doing the best they can with the resources they have, but Reddit obviously isn't prioritising stability or managing tech debt.",2023-12-05 14:54:58,1
"The UI is certainly getting better and new features like downloading images and videos directly from the app are also good. However there are certain times when app doesn't open, but this happens only occasionally. There is still room for improvement though, as there are still some issues that other reviews state.",2023-12-02 07:25:02,3
Devs wth are you doing out there? This app is like a Benjamin Button case. The general release feels like a nightly now. Videos are broken. Audio from other clips keep playing when you're way past them. It even plays audio when the app is closed! Is that a bug or a feature? EDIT: app is stable now. don't touch it!,2024-01-23 04:53:14,4
Now the experience on this app is very bad because just to see a full size picture i need to click it twice . And now I am uninstalling this app,2024-02-19 13:18:21,1
"The UI is absolutely terrible, if a post has captions along with an image, clicking on ""more"" sends you to the comments instead of showing the embedded text. The app takes forever to load and has so many unnecessary gesture controls that make browsing posts a chore.

Idk why they're trying to change the UI with each new update? It just ends up ruining the experience ugh,2024-04-18 10:48:00,1
So far I haven't had an issue with the app. It runs smooth on my phone although I just updated the app today. I'll update this post on any changes,2024-03-07 05:55:16,4

This is the fourth time I've had to jump through hoops just to delete an account that was automatically generated. I am not happy I actually have to waste my time deleting another account I never wanted because I accidentally clicked another reddit link before realizing. Only typing this so it's here for all to see now. Just STOP auto generating accounts! I would rather be stopped by a login screen so I can leave before that. You might just end up paying people like me for our time if you don't.,2024-01-03 03:30:48,1
I like this app. It can be entertaining. However they started showing every other post with things you might like when it's things I've never even heard of. Like maybe 10% of what's on there is fun. But mostly I'm just like what? Also at least once a day they have an issue where either the comments won't load or the app itself won't load. So then it's just pointless and I've noticed it happening more. But it's fun if you have hobbies and you can get help on there.,2024-01-24 17:44:39,3
Great U get multiple answers that help heaps n gives U more of an idea with pples comments so you can learn n find the right answers yr looking for I love reading the comments to questions on other subjects to n I have alot of knowledge n like helping ppl out on their questions on anything as well it makes things easier for kids n adults to find what they are looking for.

I love Redd it! The posts are very interesting and I can usually relate in one way or another!,2024-04-21 08:26:04,5

Anyone find it funny that last update of the year introduced so many app breaking bugs like not being able to scroll up? Also can't click links in an email or it'll leave you forever loading. Have to copy url then on chrome paste and look at it or it just doesn't work Original 1-23-22 Edit 12-5-23 still can't scroll half the time. And links don't always work,2023-12-08 07:09:50,1

"I gave it a 5 star but i edited to 1 cause its gotten bad. Uploading just freezes up the app, loading video is terribly slow, scrolling causes the feed to seize up. If everything on this platform that is made to do what is supposed to and it cant do the basic functions it says a lot about how much they care about their app.",2023-12-04 00:50:38,1

"Inferior Reddit app, ironically. 3rd party apps were better, but Reddit largely killed them off. I think you used to be able to change swiping gestures, but now we're stuck with no customization and a dumb default. 3rd party apps have better swiping behavior. Instead this app forces me to use the back button all the time, which is annoying when I could quickly swipe where my finger already is. Etc. Reddit app stinks.",2023-12-07 00:39:53,2

I've changed the password 3 times, but whenever I try to log into my account, it keeps saying, unable to authenticate.

I don't want to watch the video so I click the video to try and pause it. The video then fills my entire screen. Now I can pause the video. Then I click back to get back to the comments. Does this sound like a well designed app? No, it's dogshit and whoever designed this ui should get a different job.",2024-01-26 23:54:44,1
"Where to start. I have been using the app for years, and people have been complaining about the UI for a long time. To me, it was alright so far, but the latest update(s) seem to have made it completely unusable. Why are there posts determined by the algorithm in my home feed? If I wanted to find something I'm not subbed to, I'd use the popular feed. And it keeps showing things again and again from subs I've said I'm not interested in. I only updated for the recap and now I regret it.",2023-12-10 14:21:34,1
The least reliable Reddit app. It's slow as ever. Clicking on image previews to open the full-size image sometimes never works. Sometimes clicking a post to see the comments taked 10 seconds to open. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it still happens. If you're going to force everyone to use your app at least make it work.,2023-12-07 19:14:00,1
"I genuinely wonder if they made this app terrible on purpose. It's not even about the missing features from the 3rd party apps that were way better. It's the fact that this app can't seem to handle the website that it is designed for. It's clunky, glitchy, and pretty bare bones. Why does it decide to randomly scroll to the top when I am reading a post? Who decided to introduce the floating refresh button at random intervals? This app actually makes me use Reddit less.",2023-11-11 19:24:31,1
"Despite having the biggest support staff, this app is dramatically worse than other reddit apps. Less features, more bugs, and a ridiculous number of ads. The feed reminds me of Facebook just before I quit that as well because you never saw anything along the lines of what you really wanted. The only redeeming factor is the content, which they don't make anyways.",2023-12-05 15:55:12,2
"Every time you update the app, it works less and less. Images will not load anymore. Text posts/comments rarely load now. Ads are the only thing that will load. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Bring back 3rd party support. Maybe if the devs cared less about adding polygons and animating Snoo, the app would actually work. 12/21 update: NOTHING NEW WILL SHOW UP.

"Since the last update (12/4/23) the app will crash. I can't comment, look at photos or even open a thread. This is very disappointing hence why I changed it from a five to a one.

Then I can scroll through a few posts and it gets stuck again",2023-12-20 22:42:33,1

Way too many ads and frustrating lack of settings and options that others offered for free.",2023-12-05 03:57:56,1
"Sometimes I'll select post A to read it and audio from post B will play which is very annoying. Also having 5 clicks to watch a YouTube video is poor design. When navigating to view my upvoted posts, it will reset to the most recent and I have to scroll all the way back every time. Keeps asking me to link my gmail after saying no 50 times. Reddit is Fun was far superior, such a disappointment.",2024-01-06 03:17:31,1

"Edit: They have updated the site since, nothing changed but now while you wait a cute robot winks at you. The video player on the app craps out constantly. You never know if its gonna be a fun scrolling experience or tedious waiting for an image/video, even the posts and comments themselves to finally load. Sluggish since I started using it a year ago, which i assume means they aren't even looking for a fix.",2023-12-05 15:08:55,1

Issues have been present for months now.",2023-12-05 23:05:59,1
"Every time they ""improve the app"" they only make it worse, the updated interface added to the annoying parts and took away the decent stuff. If there was a better app I would use it but they killed off all the better ones. ""If it ain't broke, they'll break it"" A sub par app whose best feature is the network it provides. Other apps did its job so much better but thanks to corporate greed, they effectively killed off all of the better alternatives overnight, so now we're all stuck with this.",2024-01-26 07:41:29,1
"The app is buggy, difficult to use, and lacks many features that made other readers great. There is no longer such a thing as a curated profile. Reddit is going to push your subscriptions to the bottom of the stack and try to force you into more communities. This, plus the ads, makes it a miserable experience for the user. They didn't change the API rule because they believed in their app. They knew full well 3rd party readers were superior and that they couldn't compete.",2024-01-19 17:22:09,1
"Too many ads that are too intrusive. ""Do not recommend this subreddit"" doesn't work so I keep getting posts from polarizing subreddits. ""Turn off this type of notification"" doesn't work so I get notifications about subreddits I'm not interested in. And the forums seems to suffer more and more from bots. Going back on a thread loses where you were, in contrast to third party apps. Clicking reply can make the app close entirely",2023-12-05 10:50:59,1

"I used to love this app, but I don't like a lot of the features. Like not being able to change your username or the oversimplified app icons and such.

"The entire reason I use Reddit is the ability to tailor my feed to only things that interest me. Every three posts there's suggested content that nobody asks for. Sometimes I forgot you ruined the user experience despite the entire website having a meltdown asking you to stop and use your terrible service, so I guess it's a good thing the suggested content is always there to remind me to close it again.",2023-12-27 04:05:45,1
I used to use a third party app and after the api changes I was forced to use this. The front page sort is an AI fueled dumpsterfire that keeps showing the same subreddits. Instead of giving you the option to sort by hot like the website they removed the hot/best sorting option on purpose in favour their black box dopamine generator. After giving this a chance for a couple of months I'm back to using the website on my phone.,2023-12-13 22:32:31,1

Some videos and pictures I have downloaded recently that I would like to download again are not shown. This is disappointing. Also there is self absorbed in artistic overly demonstrative promotion of the word reddit on many pictures. Resolution is not as clear as listal.

"Has a setting to disable autoplay on videos. The setting does nothing, all videos still autoplay. Edit: now it crashes whenever I try to open a new comment input. It's fine, I'm sure engagement isn't important for a social media app",2023-12-06 22:59:29,1
"This app just really annoyed me. I was looking stuff up on Google and found the perfect explanation for what I was looking for but it was an 18+ topic and I had to download reddit, now I was okay with this at first until the app took literally 10 minutes just to download really got on my nerves. And then I had some complications logging in which annoyed me. Don't wanna wait 10 minutes just to have a question answered when the answer is right in front of me. Really ruined my mood by doing that.",2024-01-23 14:06:58,1

"Through their policies, Reddit effectively blocked third party apps and forced us to use their app which keeps adding issues after each update. Sound on nsfw gifs is broken, video/image reader just broke, etc. I also don't like the algorithm which only focus on some of my subreddit when with RedReader I could get an overview of everything.",2023-12-06 09:21:54,1
"It's beyond stupid that you don't have the option to sort through your most upvoted comments on the app, if you want someone to use an app for your social media site then you need to offer at least the basic features that are available on the desktop version App is a broken buggy mess, after all these years it's still terrible",2023-12-25 20:17:55,1

App crashes immediately when I tap on the comment field below a post. Good one. 🤦‍♂️ Last review: Legacy chat/normal chat in the app is completely broken. I can't reply to friends but they can reply to me. I can reply only in the website version of Reddit not the app. 1 month ago Reddit promised this has been fixed; it has not. Have tried fully uninstalling and reinstalling the app to no avail.,2023-12-07 02:59:51,1

I know it's false unless 'Inactivity' is against the rule as I hadn't logged in for over a month before I was suspended, and none of my art broke any rules. 2 years ago I would've said this app was among the best. Now? I would not recommend this app at all.",2023-11-10 03:06:42,1

Not a fan of being forced to use an app when there's a perfectly good website available. It's arbitrary which threads you can't view on Web and have to switch to an app because you're accessing it from a phone. I don't want unnecessary apps on my phone and I'm only a consumer of your content. Don't force people to use your app just to justify it's existence. Kill the site or let us use it.,2024-01-18 19:56:09,2

"Simply the worst social media app ever. Reddit was only usable on mobile through third party apps, and now that they have forced all of these out, they wasted no time in using their monopoly to aggressively make the mobile app even worse than it was: removing the ability to keep your data private from trackers/advertisers, and removing commission features so they can control your feed algorithm and other aspects of your settings to maximize advertising. This app feels like intentional sabotage.",2023-12-23 20:25:00,1
Talk about an app that needs work. I've been noticing my phone losing battery life quicker than normal and then I happened to notice Reddit running even though I had it turned off from any background usage. Overall it's taken a good 6% of my battery and I haven't opened it in over 48 hours. Web Access it is if I want to use it,2023-11-19 13:28:57,1
"This app is hot garbage, basic functionality like sorting your home feed, moving thumbnails to the left, etc are missing. Forcing people to an app that isn't even 50% of the functionality is a weird flex to push people away for your platform.",2023-12-29 18:14:17,1
"Awful app. Acutely felt as we had much much better options like Boost before Reddit killed them. This thing freezes, stutters, fails to load video in line sometimes. And it cannot handle links passed to it from a browser; just get a blank screen.",2024-01-24 17:48:11,1
"They didn't bother including an option to increase text size on the android version (it's available in the iPhone app...). Text size increases if you increase overall phone system test size, but is always smaller in the Reddit app than every other app, so getting Reddit to comfortably readable makes every other app look stupidly big. It's such a basic requirement to be able to adjust this.",2023-11-11 13:02:43,1
"Buggy, clunky and asks you EVERY TIME you click on a link on your phone to get the app with a pop-up and then they have the nerves to send a pop-up for ""are you enjoying reddit"" 😂.

"Ads everywhere. The app is horribly optimized to the extent that it chugs while scrolling. It wouldn't surprise me if it's struggling to load all the ads. I can't believe they shut down free third-party apps for this-- especially after encouraging their development for years. Garbage since release, and it won't ever get any better now that they're working to monopolize the mobile market. I'd rather pay for a third-party app sub, but Reddit doesn't deserve a penny from those hardworking devs.",2023-12-21 12:14:58,1
When are going to bring back the option to change the text size? Recently the text size in in the app has gone too small and it's really difficult to read. Imagine you have a 6inch display phone but the text size is too small. Hope reddit consider this and bring back the text size option back.,2023-12-27 06:11:15,1
Poor UI filled with poorly identified ads that try to disguise themselves as legitimate posts in order to trick you into clicking them. The latest update now causes the app to crash whenever I try to post a comment. Unacceptable performance considering how Reddit went out of its way to shut down third party apps.,2023-12-05 19:19:24,1

"Features don't work and it's always changing which one it is when you open the app. Even if you get through to the content, you're still on Reddit and that's just a site full of the worst most miserable losers on the planet. So, I can't see a reason to ever use this.",2024-01-20 22:17:00,1
Sometimes the app doesn't want to upload photos. It'll tell you that it's sorry but it can upload the photo. Sometimes the photos that you upload don't show up. Both issues are pretty random but happen frequently I'm about to delete the damn app and use the browser.,2023-12-03 21:46:15,1

When I get a popup asking for feedback on the app, it requires me to add what my app version is, and to get that info, I have to leave the form and cannot figure out how to get back to the feedback form. So I cannot submit feedback. When comments are heavily nested, I end up having to read paragraphs ONE LETTER AT A TIME as each word wraps by the letter. Pathetic.",2023-11-08 18:21:47,1

"I wish I could give the app 0 stars, it's somehow even worse than last time I edited my review half a year ago.

Honestly the app is a really poorly implemented ad cash grab by the product management team. Executive decisions have left once community focused initiatives empty and content is driven by engagement so the bot problem is rampant and the content is often recycled. You're better off not downloading the app and just staying online so you can maintain ad blockers; especially since they're basically committing fraud by forcing ads on users that are extremely against all forms of ads.,2023-12-06 18:52:44,1

"The comment interface is terrible. I can't see the comment I am replying to as I am replying, which means copying my reply, deleting, rereading the comment, then replying again. It also will not show an entire comment chain once there are enough replies when accessed by clicking on a notification. I can't see my reply to a comment once I reclick the notification. All it shows is ""show all comments"" which sends you back to the main post. Very poor design. I can't believe we are forced to use it.",2023-11-30 18:18:37,1

It is so infuriating, videos never load, comment sections on posts won't load, functionality of looking at replies to a comment in thread is atrocious and you can get stuck in a thread with pressing back just closing the app. By far the worst app I have to use on a regular basis. FYI all these problems been around for years",2023-12-30 15:54:01,1

"As an update, I am still really hating this app compared to the 3rd party option I used before (redditisfun). The official app is designed to monopolise your attention and keep you scrolling, no pagination to trigger a pause. The suggested posts are the bane of my life.

To be honest, it's okay for me in this regard, however - I can't translate comments in app anymore and copy/paste mechanics breaks the flow really bad. It kills this app for me, unfortunately. I give 3 out of 5 because it's not that bad and it works. It could be so much better though giving the high quality of content.",2024-01-07 17:12:47,3
"Just objectively worse than 3rd party apps. Will glitch and tell you to log in to comment, even if you're already logged in. Edit: app updated, trying to comment now crashes. Another criticism, the app will randomly scroll ALL the way back to the top of your feed. It's crazy how there were so many shining examples of how to make a reddit app, and they push this garbage app.",2023-12-05 18:10:54,1
"While I cannot say anything about third party apps as I've never used them (though I will admit it blows that they were killed off), Reddit is a good application to just browse and have a laugh. It provides lots of content that you can look for with ease via its communities and flairs. Some questionable changes have occurred as of recent, but regardless, my enjoyability of the app hasn't changed much.",2023-12-11 19:15:59,4
For being one of the top websites in the world this is by far one of the worst programmed apps. If you are easily offended then this is the perfect place for you but if you might say something that is even the slightest bit offensive then save yourself the bother because it's a safe place for all kinds and you will get banned easily. I would recommend using a third party app but that an option anymore. It's crazy that for a website that isn't free speech you are getting ready for an IPO.,2023-12-17 02:12:12,1
"Not impressed. If you want to mute a subreddit recommendation, you have to first hide the post, then choose mute. But the ""post hidden"" banner covers the mute button, forcing you to wait.

Add in delays and crashes, and I don't know why I bother. Trash.",2023-12-05 23:09:20,1

"The UX is just the worse. Like what's the deal with the popups (save post, comment, download etc) that last for eternity and keeps you from using the app ? TikTok works because it removes pain points but Reddit keep adding pain points.

UPDATE (11 DEC 2023): I notice there is a Reddit status website where you can check whether the app/web is down or operational. I checked it today because I noticed that Reddit (both app and website) are currently down and was happy to see that the status site was actually accurate and showed that there is an issue. It got me thinking that there should be a Reddit status app. An app you can download where you can check Reddit's status and see what issues it's having. Just a thought though 🙂,2023-12-11 17:53:55,3

"The worst UX possible for Reddit. Can't go back to the homescreen in a single button, not intuitive for search, and very limited capabilities overall. Terrible app.",2023-12-31 06:11:42,2
Media still doesn't load. I tried all of the ways to fix it but it still doesn't work. I only started using this a week or so ago but no content ever loads. I really tried all sorts of fixes and nothing works. The app is broken. Edit: it just doesn't work,2023-11-26 04:17:18,1

"Sent me a weird notification which took me to a unknown sub which just had a scam link in. This was content Reddit felt I'd be interested in?

"Get lost for hours! Great app, it just works never had any issues with it at all!",2024-03-16 16:32:30,5
I wish I wasn't such with this app. It's just so clunky. It doesn't really let you look at other subreddits you want to see but tries to advertise ones they want you to see. I can only use it for few minutes before I'm annoyed enough to get off reddit. Also why comments collapse when you touch them is being me. What a silly worthless feature that is detecting from using the app. No wonder their valuation keeps failing. Can't zoom in on videos either.,2023-11-25 15:09:32,1

Where you wouldn't get bombarded with keyboard warriors but now it's hard to even find a neutral topic to enjoy with it being injected with politics. Reddit became a headache and I can't recommend it to anyone. You will be a better person for not using it. A site of people so lost they became the fascists in the process of ""fighting fascism"". Go outside.",2024-02-24 20:00:34,1

Understand your base, your working for them not yourself. Listen to the feedback and implement ideas. Show your base you care about their suggestions. Most importantly fix the issues within the app. The 3 star average speaks a thousand words. Currently rating this 2 stars. Show me this is worthy of 5.",2024-01-02 00:39:23,2
"I would say 3 people out of 200 have contacted, turned out, were not scammers and cons. Those 3 were actually nice. Now I would say the majority of real reddit users were just real dicks. I had a female moderator turn out to be black and made racist comments to me because something I said which I thought was a compliment turned out it was really duragatory slang, but I didn't know that because I see people using it all the time and the ladies being spoken to like that eat it up and giggle",2024-04-16 21:58:14,1

No issues giving Karma, yet the inability to receive makes the experience incomplete & 1-sided, reminiscent of Facebook's freedom of speech restrictions.

In a general overview of the Reddit app itself I consider it the best of social media sites. In terms of the ability to generate a sub it can be bulky and a bit confusing and somewhat destructive in places. But I'm still learning this process ask me again in several months. Individual subs though over all are not generalized most stick to one subject only which I find quite restrictive. Many moderators do seem to be on power trips banning for very minor infractions a different subject,2024-01-31 13:57:05,5

"what I don't like about it is when posts are deleted even when nothing is violated, and also the timer between replying to comments. it's such a hassle to wait for it and the momentum of inquiring or seeking for help is no longer there. i went to reddit to ask a question but it is always deleted. also, when a picture is uploaded when I'm asking for a source is not helpful at all since they are often taken down. unless you already have a lot of karma, the post will be prioritized",2024-02-02 17:13:15,1
I would give the app a better rating. But. The chat is horribly messed up again. Messages disappear after being sent. The app always seems to have glitches/bugs. Samsung Galaxy s22 Ultra. Android version 14.,2024-02-08 06:14:31,2

Oh I nearly forgot to mention the lack of accessibility; visually impaired users are apparently not welcome in the mobile Reddit app!",2023-10-31 08:27:58,1

Forgets your settings every time you close the app. Does not load things properly. Terrible UI design. Absolute embarrassment of an app coming from a large company.

(Originally from 2021 but still the same) [As most people knows reddit has problems but now it's getting unusable videos are slow loading on wifi and cellular scrolling down blank pages is pointless yet the ads load no problem.] Updated : Also the past year has been rough not only is data being treated horribly but so is the community that 2.9 rating is coming soon. If you're looking for a new CEO I'll put my name in the hat. Reddit could be next level within 6 months.,2023-11-30 23:30:13,1
Reddit is great it's app and interface is horrible instead of buying one of the really successful apps that we've all been using for years they killed them all and make us use their horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible app They could do so much better but their extreme stubbornness basically is they could death by a 1000 cuts,2024-01-13 19:02:09,1

Post arbitrarily not load, you may be scrolling and it'll suddenly take you back 7 clicks ago. Can't find the lost post cos search is useless. Have to constantly restart the app. Exhausting. App performance significantly deteriorated in the period the third party apps / API issues, never recovered. I end up browsing reddit via mobile browser.",2023-11-07 13:42:33,1
Unintuitive and terrible UI. Plus lots of bugs.,2024-02-10 18:27:04,1
To be absolutely honest they haven't gone soft you can watch all kinds of videos other platforms wouldn't because they are lame 🤷,2024-02-24 04:14:42,5
Refreshing post does not update upvote count. Have to restart the app after clearing cache to see the update count of upvotes.,2024-04-20 12:37:46,1
The way they went about 3rd party disappoints me and makes me dislike this application even more. Overall It's not a good app. It's slow and not user friendly. Edit - updates have been making the app more useful and enjoyable but not to the point that Apollo was bringing. Updated to 2 stars.,2023-12-31 18:29:37,2
"Reddit: what can I say? Whatever the hell I want! It's a forum of forums. I've clicked on search results that led me there over the years but somehow never joined or really dived in.

Absolutely useless bunch. Everyone just arbitrarily decides what you get to do and there are no second chances. No one explains anything and a few get to decide who advances. Its not revolutionary it just sucks like all the rest but is even harder to understand how the rules work because there aren't any concrete ones.,2024-01-03 16:24:15,1

"Pretty good app. Just about any subject matter a person might be interested in, they could possibly find it here.",2024-03-20 11:43:49,5

"I wish I could give 0 stars. Nothing would load after updating app. Uninstalled and reinstalled and now it won't let me log in. I used the password reset and it just says, oops something went wrong. So now I can't get in all. Horrible app.",2024-01-24 18:01:05,1
Shame this app is the only option. It is terrible for navigation. Ads everywhere,2024-02-14 22:21:07,1
Ads are too intrusive. Prompts asking me to sign up for alerts are annoying,2024-04-12 06:50:48,2

"Have had a bug for about an entire YEAR now, after scrolling just a couple posts I can longer keep scrolling. At least it helps with screen on time. No fix out there has worked. I've tried them all",2024-01-22 11:16:32,1
Forcing me to use the Reddit app if I open Reddit from mobile browser. Yet I can't even login to my account from the app. Annoying.,2024-02-12 10:56:24,1

Would get 5 stars but there's one thing you need to do is so if you send a private message you can see if there haven't opened it or seen it and not texting please,2024-03-18 08:02:05,4
It's fine for just scrolling. There are a few bugs such as all videos being labeld as gif images in parts. There are also a few things missing from the web site like viewing things you have upvoted.,2024-01-10 23:13:01,3
This one is simply inferior to the other 3rd party app I use for reddit. And it's pretty evident by seeing the review rating on here being 3.5 as of this writing while the other app that has had to shut down that I've used for years was at a 4.9. update: the rating is now at a 3 and it shows that it belongs lower as I have had worse experiences with this app then rif before your apk nonsense. Won't load videos right after coming back to app because they work worse than YouTube shorts.,2023-11-30 05:40:59,1
Such a laggy app. It does not load video but for advertisements it loads it in full HD 🤡,2024-04-16 14:02:32,1
Garbage app. Bring back the free api or make the pricing way more affordable for 3rd party Devs. UI doesn't make sense compared to Baconreader. search function is barely useable just like the site. Gallery view is basically a tiktok rip off which I don't like. The only way I'll be using this app is if the feature set become better than all the 3rd party apps.,2024-02-11 05:29:34,1
Everyone was really helpful and kind to me and the platform is really cool and easy to navigate.,2024-03-09 14:20:28,5

"1. The company has taken away the ability to use third party applications to browse the website. This means you have to deal with their terrible app maintenance, like how I'm unable to make comments as the app crashes. 2. They have given themselves permission to sell your data to third party companies. Only place where this isn't the case is the EU. The problem with reddit is more fundamental now. As both as service provide and company. It's too late to ask for change now.",2023-12-05 07:44:23,1

With the disabling of 3rd-party apps, most of the serious utility for professionals and hobbyists has been sidelined in favor of algorithmically-fed content aimed at teenagers. Gone is the ability to tailor your feed to your interests: you are constantly fed random posts, unrelated to your interests, and managing them in your feed becomes exhausting.

They intentionally drove 3rd party apps out of business so they could force everyone to use this ad filled piece of garage.

This app is so buggy lately. Back arrows don't work anymore. The down arrow doesn't work to jump to the next parent comment anymore either.

"They never figured out video uploads, which is what finally killed the app and made me trash it",2024-04-22 20:41:16,1
As a 35 year old app reviewer I've found this app so worth the download an ads are minimum yet nessary of course an the primium content worth paying for an you are sure to find a friend circle online here reddit has security like other social media urls but obviously social filters offline an parental control settings set on your child's phone an passwords set are nessary,2024-04-11 16:41:57,5
Yeah it seems to become worse with every update. Removing awards was not a smart move. But still love my communities here,2024-04-20 13:51:21,2

Like most comments. Found individuals' expertise and recommendations very helpful.,2024-04-20 00:03:45,5
How can I change the new gesture (swipe left to see the next post) (swipe up to see the comments) back to normal in the Reddit App? The new gesture is terrible for bigger screens as well as user experience in all screen sizes.,2024-02-02 00:11:13,2

There are many better apps for browsing Reddit (personal favourite is RIF), but Reddit is also planning on killing them, so YMMV.",2023-06-05 09:38:50,1
"I used to only use Reddit is fun and now that they close that I'm using this... I liked how before the thumbnails of everything on the front page or what's hot was actually like the size of thumbnails and now every post is like the size of my screen. Makes me not really want to go on here but I still do because Reddit is way better than Facebook, Twitter and Instagram",2024-01-11 00:57:11,4
"I just want the site! But reddit believes it is a good idea to prevent you from reading a part of its content on the website (which is totally mobile-friendly as it is) and force you to install an app with exactly the same capabilities. Well, apart from it's cache taking up 1gb space. I guess, it can be useful for those actively chatting on reddit since it does send push-notifications. But there were a lot of recommendation notifications I didn't want, so I disabled all of them.",2023-06-09 02:28:38,1
"One star for that non working online status display that I've been trying to turn off for the last 30 minutes to no avail... I can't believe it was implemented in the first place and I can't believe it's not off automatically. The app is buggy and riddled with ads, I'm sick of using it, because it just leaves me disappointed constantly. No idea how one can mess up so badly. Unusable.",2023-06-13 19:10:49,1
"Awful reddit browsing app, that is intentionally designed poorly to maximize revenue. The biggest issues with it are that 1) It is very difficult to distinguish ads from user posts because they use the same fonts and textures. 2) thumbnails are on the right hand side which makes no sense at all because the eye is naturally drawn to media, but then you have to look back to the left to read the title. I'm always scanning side to side instead up scrolling up/down 3) UI needs a total revamp",2023-07-03 15:05:27,1
"So, I just reinstalled the app, and tried to log in, and noticed it was giving me a ""wrong password"" error, so I kept trying, and no matter what, it wouldn't work. So I went on the website, and tested out the exact same login credentials and it worked. How the hell do they screw up an app this bad. Plus they've now removed the ability to log in via google, which made things much quicker",2022-12-07 23:27:23,1
"Video player is still awful after months. Having to fully open videos to pause, forward or rewind, is completely unnecessary. Have to double back out of comments on videos. Too many time I've double backed on an image or a text post and it's taken me right back to the top of my feed. (Just pick one or the other!) Still can't select tags on videos in subs. Video player was perfect before, useless update. Literally making the user experience worse.",2022-03-21 21:13:05,1
"Change the icon back to orange please, it's something that bothers me when browsing my apps. I know it's for a good cause (BLM) but I think the impact is so minimal (if there's any) compared to the negative impact of changing the basic color palette of a app. You can share ideals without changing the basic palette color of your app like many others do. Really surprised that this change was even the choice of sharing the ideals of BLM on the app, that's pretty immature for a app so big.",2020-07-06 15:28:33,1
"Most external links and media do not work. Opening external links in a browser does not work at all. Selecting text to copy it, is impossible. After scrolling a bit, clicking the thumbnail can open a different discussion thread. The same issue exists with video and audio. All in all, it seems like most content on reddit, remains inaccessible because of how buggy this app is. This review box does not offer enough space to list every basic thing that this app does wrong.",2023-08-28 10:57:32,1
"the most recent update has totally wrecked this app. it's beyond slow; closing a comment thread takes up to 10 seconds when it used to be instant. closing/backing out of a picture or video has to be done twice, because it loads two instances of the picture/video for no reason. sometimes when scrolling down into the comments on a picture/video post, the picture gets cut in half and the comments section breaks entirely, with no buttons working. I use Reddit a ton, but it's really annoying now.",2019-05-13 17:29:05,2
Was a great app but have gone downhill by a lot lately. Was draining battery like crazy due to the amount of DNS requests to a tracking domain. Had over 9 thousand request pr. day. But that is not all. Changes to UI almost every month with a new thing being either moved or breaking with each update. Also if you are using web it forces you to the app. Would not recommend anymore. Find an alternative.,2022-07-25 15:02:27,1
"As a userof Reddit for 11+ years, I find this app is terrible, the worst experience for using Reddit. You can't sort anything properly, you can't view anything properly because one post takes up the entire screen and is surrounded by ads. It doesn't save your settings properly (compact view, video player settings etc.) There is a chat feature that nobody uses and is just filled with bots trying to sell you sex. There are no accessibility features so if you have an impairment you are screwed.",2023-06-06 08:41:44,1
"Didn't realise I'd reviewed it at 5*, so amended given use over last ~3 years. As an app, this is pretty poor. Slow, data intensive, inconsistent with how to load pages, and the UI is (at times) horrendous. For the most part it does *technically* do the job (thus 2 rather than 1 stars), but I can't recommend it. Not that there will be a choice in a month anyway!",2023-06-10 18:25:46,2
"The May 2023 update has basically broken my home feed. I use Reddit to browse image subs and the inability to sort posts by ""New"" in Card mode has made it much, much harder to find and view the content I want. Either I can view feed images in fullscreen but not sort by recent posts, or see the most recent but have images in thumbnail view. Neither of these works for me, and both was an option this morning. I'm seriously considering downloading a third-party app, or just perhaps going outside.",2023-05-19 22:27:20,2
"The refresh button has gotten quite annoying. It pops up after not that long, doesn't disappear, and when I do refresh the posts on top on my feed don't really change, just the order, so I have to scroll back to where I was anyway. Also, I've used the internet before, I can figure out how to refresh something if I want to without you having to shove it in my face.",2018-12-10 19:18:34,3
"What a truly horribly set up app. It continues to randomly crash, preventing any semblance of ""getting lost in posts"". Videos do not load, or if they do, it keeps looping - which requires that you force-close the app. Not to mention that it's incredibly busy looking too, exhausting to scroll through vs. a clean look. Definitely recommend alternatives out there.",2023-06-01 11:01:51,1
"The app started off great. Around a year ago it started to slow down on both devices. Videos can only be watched once. Gifs that are just solid pictures. Images refusing to load in the full resolution. But most annoying is scrolling down and it just stops refreshing the page, so you have to restart the app. Karma doesn't refresh on the main profile page and The amount of karma that you have is often incorrect.",2019-11-05 07:34:53,2
"The app and site in general are more than worthy of 5 stars, but the new layout is so obscure and confusing. It runs smooth and it looks nice, but I can't for the love of me locate anything. Once I'm accessing a post, clicking back just exist the app altogether and when I go back into it, the same thing happens, so I'm just completely unable to go back to my home page, notifs and chats. I also don't have a way of posting on whatever reddit I end up stuck on. Please just have all these options accessable at all times, no matter how much help I take online, I'm still lost.",2018-09-20 06:49:56,2
"Video player is an absolute broken dumpster fire. Thanks for screwing over third party apps reddit; I want to use a third party app because your app blows. I want to go to comments on a video. I press the comment button. This opens the comments but the video continues to play in the upper half of the screen. First of all, why? Then I try to pause the video, which brings the video back to fullscreen for some reason without pausing. Finally, the back arrow closes the entire video. Infuriating.",2023-06-24 19:20:20,1
The app compared to the 3rd party apps is night and day. Pretty much unbearable to use. The UI is unintuitive. There is next to no customisation to allow you to setup things how you like it. Once you've viewed a post and want to go back to the subreddit list it does not remember where in the list you were. Posts load slower. Scrolling is stuttering. Opening a v.redd.it post plays the video even when you only selected to see the comments. Gesture control is non-existent. Utter shambles.,2023-07-01 11:38:22,1
"There is no landscape mode, and the image viewer is terrible. The algorithm constantly shows you stuff you don't care about. There is no way to sort your feed by Hot. I'm trying to swipe through pictures, and instead of showing me the next picture in the feed, it will load a completely random picture. Sometimes from a completely different subreddit. The app works (when it isn't laggy or reloading), but it simply isn't what I expect from a social media app in 2023.",2023-08-30 13:38:29,1
"Animated images are always frozen, videos never play, sometimes even pictures show up black, threads often get ""stuck"" making it impossible to open other threads without a full app restart. This is just scratching top of this app's problems iceberg. In past you could've just used a third-party app which fixed all these issues. But no more! I suggest moving to Lemmy.",2023-07-03 12:42:42,1
"Don't install this app. It's terrible. Notifications don't work or are delayed, features simply don't work, the app design is inconsistent and confusing, and user experience is sidelined to give more screen space to advertising. Reddit knows about all of these issues, but rather than invest any time or money into fixing them, they simply choose to block better apps from working. Since Reddit itself is a terrible platform anyway, just don't bother using it.",2023-06-14 17:43:29,1
The app is very slow. It happens quite often that I have to tab a post multiple times until it opens and then it opens of course as often as I tapped. Sometimes videos and picture also don't load. Only restarting the app works. It's way more comfortable to use Reddit in a browser or in one of the other unofficial apps. The whole experience is just painful.,2023-06-25 15:36:34,1
"Good app, works well for browsing reddit assuming you can adjust to the ""new"" reddit... or you even know what I mean by that. -1: because it does have instability, seemingly an issue from long browsing sessions. the app will visibly slow down and sometimes crash without error message. -1: Need better data saving optimization. This app is a data hog, which is almost crazy for what amounts to a bazaar of text forums. Even with thumbnails and video autoplay off, it chews away at your data plan.",2019-07-06 12:32:55,3
"The app is proud to advertise that, until I sign up, I won't be able to configure notifications (I've been spammed on a daily basis without having opened it not even once).

Congratulations on ""stimulating engagement"".",2018-10-08 00:19:19,1
"Extremely slow, buggy and unstable app; not to mention battery-hungry. Post feed sometimes fails to refresh. Chat is extremely fragile to the point of not functioning at all: sending of messages frequently does not work; new messages are sometimes not displayed on refresh. All of the aforementioned bugs require restart of the application, which is extremely annoying. However, the tipping point after which I uninstalled it was when the sending of chat messages simply stopped working at all.",2019-12-24 21:49:51,1
"Where is my previous reviews? I initially rated this app 2 stars, now it's only 1 because you remove my previous review, This app is so unresponsive, ads are infesting the feed, I can not use the app for more than 10 minutes without it freezing and crashing, this problem has been going on seen the ""new"" interface update which is sometime in 2019 or something, I can't remember correctly, the point is,its been years and this app is still freezing and crashing, and some video failed to load.",2021-02-02 15:24:36,1
"Awful experience overall. The UI is somehow both is tiny while showing far less posts than third-party apps due to poor layout and excessive white space. Every third post is an add or a ""recommended"" sub I don't care about and you can't turn that off. A lot of UI lag and loading for every action, every button press is followed by a half second of waiting or some slow animation. Videos fail to play, does not pre-load link post websites.",2023-06-09 09:46:41,1
"Reddit has indirectly phased out the use of third-party apps, forcing users to navigate its native platform. Unfortunately, this change has resulted in a less intuitive user interface, decreased stability, and a reduced feature set compared to what third-party apps used to offer. Additionally, the increase in advertisements has added another layer of frustration to the user experience.",2023-07-15 18:54:59,1
"I tried to use this app, but there are many issues: Poor utilisation of the screen space, poor layout between content / lots of wasted space. The amount of ads that you are bombarded with, not only actual ads, but content that is actually an ad instead. Lack of moderation ability. Videos won't load or play. No customability to the layout of content. The irrelevant notifications. I could go on, but the fact that this is the forced direction means I spend way less time on reddit.",2023-07-18 09:51:01,1
"There's been a bug where clicking any post opens a specific post I've previously opened. For example, if I have previously opened a post A through F, a bug may direct any further clicks after post B to open post B instead of what I wanted.   The bug is still persisting after a few months.  Even worse, the app has been significantly slower over the last few updates - it takes 5-10 seconds to load a list of posts or messages, and the media contents takes forever to load even when I'm using over 100mbps ethernet.",2018-11-19 18:31:26,3
"I'd give zero stars if I could... This app is so bad. Some really basic functionality is missing (can't sort front page by Hot), it's very difficult to discern adds from real content (which is just slimey if intentional, and embarrassingly bad design if not) the view is bulky and not easy to read. I find myself waiting to use reddit until I'm near my desktop despite the obvious convenience of a smartphone. It's almost as though the people who created the app don't use it themselves, ever.",2023-07-16 03:36:00,1
It's absolutely crazy that they shut down all those third-party apps and didn't even try to hire any of them to make a good alternative. Just a completely unfriendly user experience. No long-press on videos/images as an alternate to the button all the way on the top of the screen. It can't go 60 seconds without some kind of popup asking if I want notifications or something turned on. Doesn't seem like I can access settings while I'm browsing a subreddit. I can't sort my front page by new/top/etc,2023-09-08 18:50:28,1
"Until I discovered RIF, I had used this app for years. RIF showed me what a good Reddit app is supposed to and can be like. After RIF got taken down due to overzealous profit driven corporate strategy, I tried the app again. I just uninstalled it.

"Screw reddit and screw their predatory site design. Everything forces you onto the app where they can push you adds. Web versions of reddit flag content as 18+ and for some reason need you to use the app, but you can still view the exact same articles in desktop mode without the ""use in app"" popup that prevents you from viewing pages. The desktop version on phones runs horribly, and the app sucks. Photos struggle to upload, notifications are not customizable, you need either all or none.",2022-06-06 19:50:38,1
"At the current state and with questionable/broken UI/UX changes, I cannot recommend this app. Feed, comment section, video player...

Being a mobile developer myself, I don't think the app is being properly tested before releases.",2022-02-20 07:48:33,1

This notification pops up blocking the page asking you to view through the app, or return to r/popular. More recently, you can not scroll down when the ""THIS LOOKS BETTER IN THE APP"" notification pops up. You have to refresh and hope it doesn't pop up. Let me browse how I want, without interrupting. Enough with the ad!",2022-12-02 23:57:17,1
"The new layout is broken in so many ways. Besides being horribly unintuitive it's a step back functionally: It breaks on opening large resolution pictures. Doesn't even go into a load screen, it just gets stuck forcing you to quit the app. Switching between the media viewer and comments is fidgety at best, half the time I'm just trying to pause a video and I open comments or vice versa. It's packed with ads, like every 5th post is advertisment. So much more I can't list in 500 words ...",2022-07-07 01:15:29,1
"Sluggish - and lots of ads. I'm not quite sure how Reddit have failed so badly with this app, but it's painfully slow, with constant stuttering when scrolling. It's also absolutely loaded with ads.

At its core, it works as intended, but when you actually do use it, there are many bugs that just gets fixed, but with new ones added in. I've never once used it without encountering a single bug.

For some reason when trying to load or reproduce some videos/gifs/images, it keeps loading continously and doesnt load some media, its weird because you can close and reopen the exact same media and wont load for ever, but will load others fine. I get this problem randomly and it stucks with 1 single media, so it's kinda random and kinda frequent. Other than that loading problem, everything else works like butter, real smooth.",2021-04-01 06:41:20,3

The video player is by far one of the worst visually (out of other video players I've used), often not even playing the video, having a shaded overlay whenever you try to skip in the video which makes it harder to see whats happening in the video. I've always used RIF, so this app is such a downgrade.",2023-08-14 06:41:58,1
It's like they're intentionally making the whole experience worse for the user with every update. Taking away any control you have and making it more frustrating to interact with. Pointlessly moving and changing things that no one needed or asked for. Adding in more and more steps to achieve the same thing that in a previous iteration would have taken half the time to get to what you want. I've never seen an app take such a sharp deliberate nose dive in my life.,2022-07-31 18:06:11,1

Swiping up after watching the video now makes it scroll to the next one instead of closing it, and swiping left no longer takes you to the next post. The ""skip to next comment"" button is also broken; it keeps moving to the topmost left corner (under my camera) and it doesn't work there. You can move it (with a lot of effort), but it just defaults back.",2022-05-14 05:13:38,1

The worst part is, when you try clicking on something and your sitting there ages, and when you finally are able to look at the post, it sends you somewhere else. It's also filled with annoying ads but at least you can scroll past them, scrolling is a buggy mess, most of the items for your avatar are locked by reddit premium, and the worst part of all is the awful video player. Reddit is also a cesspool echo chamber.",2023-07-07 21:49:14,1
"Ads play full sound when not even on the screen. Every single time I open the app, whenever I exit a sub or even exist a post on the front page or scrolling my feed. Really frustrating. Will fix rating when this issue is addressed. Edit: I have come to learn that its not even just ads anymore that'll play while off screen. I will be browsing MY FEED and random videos from THE FRONT PAGE will start playing with full sound. Pathetic. EDIT: this problem was solved and is now back again. Fix this!!",2021-03-20 16:21:03,1
"Outright unusable some times. Have to reinstall the app multiple times a day just because it refuses to load if operating on a WiFi but works fine on a mobile network. Although the interface is very user-friendly and most communities are very nice, some bugs in this app must be ironed out. I'd go as far as to say it feels like using an unstable version of the app. I really like this website, but please reddit, fix this. Hopefully, they will.",2021-02-24 17:33:52,2
"As expected the official Reddit app has been far from satisfactory. From the moment I downloaded it, I encountered numerous frustrating issues that severely impacted my overall enjoyment. The app's user interface felt cluttered and unintuitive, making navigation a tedious task. Moreover, the app's performance was subpar at best. Frequent crashes, slow loading times, and a lack of fluidity in scrolling through posts further exacerbated my frustrations.",2023-08-04 10:30:06,1
"What the kriff why did you change the UI again?! I absolutely abhor how switching between 'Home' and 'Popular' now involves a dropdown. There was nothing wrong with the old layout! Now you have wasted space at the top, and a new frustrating process of switching pages. EDIT: You guys would rather do anything else, like eff up the UI for the nth time, instead of fixing the video playback problem huh?",2023-04-28 00:08:45,1
Although I am enjoying the app very much but the one thing that is making my stay sorrowful is lagging of app. It lags or stops working. This phenomenon happens more than once in a single day. It is irritating and making my phone lag as well. Other thing I would like to be improved is that cache volume. The app downloads heavy caches on the device consuming a huge number of storage. There are no audio in the videos posted on reddit. Thank you.,2021-03-10 07:18:31,1
"I'd rate the app with 0 stars if I could, it's trash, slow, lacks a lot of essential features (Gallery view anyone?), too many ads The design looks ok but it's very unintuitive, there's no customization whatsoever. 3rd party apps used to be much better, I cannot fathom how a 3rd party app that's developed by a single developer (Boost for example) was much better, like way superior in every single way. Meanwhile a multi hundred million company can't come up with an app that's remotely usable.",2023-07-19 10:57:08,1
"Look, Reddit is cool. But the app sucks. Sometimes it doesn't work and doesn't load anything, but Reddit in the browser works. Sometimes it doesn't load images and videos when actually opening them. And now they redesigned the post view and you get flung through space and time if you open a post and wanna check comments before they're loaded (and they take a solid 2 to 4 seconds to load). App is bad. Hope it gets better.",2022-02-23 07:08:01,2
"Reddit app is horrible. Must be intentionally so because there used to be other third party apps which were far more user friendly until Reddit killed them all. I don't want to use the app at all because of how horrible it is to use. Full of ads and content I don't subscribe to. Very poorly optimized for viewing and the algorithm seems to work different from the third party apps, in a bad way. Loading times are way slower and I've immediately run into bugs and glitches. Just terrible.",2023-07-17 15:21:25,1
"Terrible app on a tablet. The layout is not optimized, forces you to switch between landscape and portrait all the time. The layout is confusing without clear borders and proper padding. Ads are not clearly marked making you think it is regular content, making the confusion worse. Rendering is also not smooth, causing stutters when scrolling. Apps such as BaconReader have this figured out for more than a decade by now, but Reddit is making those better options no longer available to us.",2023-06-25 09:32:45,1
"This app sucks. I don't like how it keeps pushing notifications, even when turned off. I've even got ""trending"" posts that aren't even trending, just trageted ads basically. I could search one thing, and have that constantly pop up via notification from Reddit. As if it's trying to get me to continue looking at something I legit just googled for 5 seconds. I don't care for that, and it's truly annoying. Plus half the communities are garbage.",2020-12-01 00:13:58,1
The last few UI changes have been absolute garbage with the last one rendering the app almost impossible to use. When you open a post and start scrolling to the comments you're catapulted into a different feed that has nothing to do with the post itself or your own followed subs. Videos won't load at all sometimes and when they do you have to tap 3 (!) different buttons to comment. At times the video will start playing but the screen is black. Frustrating.,2022-03-07 08:30:51,2
"This is a ridiculous app. Every other week a new bug comes in. The latest ones:(1) after a few seconds of opening a subreddit, a blank screen appears, (2) can't vote the last comment of a post, (3) can't play video properly. Edit(Sep 7, 2023): the app is a nightmare. One more new issue: When I try to come out of a thread, it's sending me back to the top of the subreddit!",2023-09-07 08:00:52,1
"They change the layout of the app too often and to the point where I have to go into my settings just to sort my homepage (hot/new/top) when it was perfectly fine where it was (on the same page as the homefeed). When I select a post to read, a random video from the previous page on the feed will start playing. You would think since this app has been out for however many years they would have made it better, but it has only gotten worse. All around bad, do better reddit you can afford it",2023-07-25 16:53:35,1
"Completely inferior to RIF, this is completely stripped of features. It's slow, doesn't allow for saving or sharing images, I cannot do hardly anything and it already crashed trying to play a video. How did Reddit think this was ready enough to compete? I guess that's why they blocked API access for anyone but them. It's a Tonka toy app. Not worth browsing Reddit anymore, especially now everyone's free work and content has been exploited. Ads appear broken in a lot of cases, notifications too.",2023-07-02 08:37:41,1
"Reddit has gone down the drain. Even after repeated updates it keeps bugging out. The video player has its own mood,sometimes it plays, others it just stops, no play/pause works, nothing. If you try to open a post from the notifications, it just bugs out and takes you to the homepage and not to the post. Initially when I joined reddit, it was much better than it is nowdays.",2023-06-15 11:44:45,1
"The way the app uses internet data is inefficient, it loads lots of pics/gifs, vids all at once. So for those with slow internet like myself, experience lots of buffering issues and in the process consume a lot of data. It should only load the posts that are in display, and maybe just 2 or 3 more that are below it ( for optimization's sake). As for features, I would love to see the mobile versions of subreddit themes.",2019-03-21 10:39:12,4
"Not a good app, constantly have to reload the all so it loads videos and by then you've lost where you have been browsing, the app also takes a tremendous amount of mobile data. This was fixed in another app while also being better for your mobile data by not loading videos/pictures in full resolution. Sadly reddit made a few changes and the apps no longer work. I deleted my reddit account and have moved on, I advise you to stay off this platform as they threaten their userbase and mods!!!!!!!!!",2023-07-07 23:56:58,1
"There is no barely any customization for colours and feed view, there's no way to change or turn off the gesture navigation. The search function is good but when I go to view a profile it shows the last one I looked at even after closing the app and clearing the cache it still shows the last profile. The video quality seems inconsistent, if you go to the link source the video looks great but watching it in the app (even over wifi) the video quality drops.",2023-07-02 10:57:27,1
"Over time the experience has really deteriorated. It seems to me that the development team is only interested in achieving some sort of ""slickness"" while neglecting problems and constantly making the app worse. Most recently, they began hiding details of the poster, making difficult to discern if a post is genuine. The UI is often confusing and sometimes downright disfunctional (e.g. custom lists are a nightmare to deal with). Just a bad experience overall.",2023-04-08 18:47:12,2
"Full of ads disguised as content, and so many of them that I got to see what I actually subscribed to for maybe two posts before another ad appeared, the UI is abysmal and full of empty space, it doesn't support many accessibility tools such as screen readers, it has too many bugs to even list, the list goes on. And rather than fix anything, at all, Reddit instead jacks up the price of its API, attempting to kill 3rd party apps and force the use of this one. Disgusting.",2023-06-13 01:07:22,1
"5+ years of using this app, I'm NEVER using it again. So many bad things about this app. Accessibility is non existant. Bugs bugs bugs. Watching videos is unbearable; videos never loading, buffering, horrendous play/stop button (causes the video control thingy to hide when you don't want to hide it). If you open the comments, and click the pause button for the video, the video doesnt stop, it instead closes the comments and puts the video full screen again. Unwanted scroll to top. Too many ads.",2023-07-02 13:09:40,2
Terrible experience. Trying to press links in the comment almost always hides the entire comment and I have to tap on it to unhide and repeat the process. The new update makes quitting a video even harder. Hitting the back button opens comments. It's really frustrating. Pausing the video to read the comments is also really hard and sometimes the video doesn't pause.,2023-07-11 14:47:17,1
"The app is generally buggy overall and filled with tons of ads. A lot of the time, video players buffer and the video won't play or the resolution is so low you can hardly see anything. Sometimes opening a comment section opens up a completely different post. There are posts that I like but the user experience is bad. I just want to watch my cat videos in peace😭",2023-06-05 06:20:07,2
"Reddit can't handle changes in device orientation, does not offer any formatting options, sends stupid notifications with no regards to if you've seen posts before and it's generally a pretty frustrating experience, because it just clicks on links and videos, if you move your phone... Do not recommend this app. UPDATE: This app is now unusable. UX is one of the worst I've ever seen. Download other apps for browsing the website. They're faster, easier to use and much more beautiful.",2022-01-23 22:35:43,1
"Battery killer. Fine in the background but in active use, chat drained my battery by 20% in about an hour. Beyond that, I struggle to keep track of (my) new (and old) posts, comments and messages. I wish all communication was structured in a single tab for the phone app, rather than a sort of remap of Reddit's PC ui to a phone. Together with the battery issue being old, it suggests an inward looking dev culture. Unfortunate, as the app itself actually works very well.",2022-07-17 12:05:25,3
"Official app has gotten so much worse in the past few months. Notifications lead you to the home page half the time. Hiding a community doesn't stop it from send you a notification all the dam time, even if you haven't visited the sub in years. Video player is still broken half the time. And the download notification is just awful. Used to be discreet and not take up much space, now there is a giant white bar at the bottom for a few seconds. Plus the app lags constantly. Fix this please.",2023-09-13 19:04:06,2
"Extremely buggy and poorly designed app. The video player barely works, the whole interface is unintuitive and has enourmous wastes of space which makes navigating content a frustrating experience, and this is not to mention the complete lack of any accessibility features. Any of the third party apps do a better job at every single one of these points, although unfortunately Reddit Inc is attempting to kill those off.",2023-06-16 18:56:33,1
"Oh hey look, the app is broken again. Which is it this time? Autoplay settings not working? Images not loading? Not able to post? No! Today's special bug is comments not showing up on any post at all! What an overly tweaked, ad-infested mess this app is. I don't think I've used it once in the past 3 years where I didn't have to deal with some bug, glitch, or random problem.",2023-05-26 19:20:50,1
Something is wrong with this app. Despite having selected Autoplay to Never. The app consumes an abnormal amount of bandwidth. I would say that it loads the videos irrespective of the selection. And only gives the option to you to play which doesn't make any sense. I just wanna save some bandwidth can you please make this change.,2020-11-15 18:21:36,1
"This UI just keeps getting worse. Ads barely look distinct from posts. After an update, clicking on a crosspost takes me to reddit's browser (which I have turned OFF in settings), and initates a popup prompting me to go to the app. IN THE APP. So much to unpack in that experience alone; why on earth is clicking on a crosspost so difficult now? As well, clicking on a video post, then hitting the back button, will make the full screen instead of taking you back to your feed. It's just... obnoxious",2022-02-07 23:31:39,1
"The app was great (4*), but they changed the layout on one(1) of the accounts i use. And it's a change for the worst. Everything moved to unintuitive locations, and they added some useless discovery thing, in the place of the communities tab, which was the only tab i used. Also, the ads are annoying, and you can't block ads you dont want to see, even if you blacklist the accounts they are posted from. Reporting them used to make them go away for a while, but that has since stopped wirking.",2022-01-22 08:23:28,1
"Swiping through posts are a great feature, but if it's to be a top-app feature, it needs to be better. I really hate the inconvenience swiping video to video where they're not of proper size. Having to go to press the full screen button each time, in transition from post to post. I love reddit, and how its managed, but this feature needs improving if it's to not fall behind apps with a well working 'reels' feature - where videos are of convenient resolution, like tiktok, Instagram, even facebook",2021-06-20 02:55:46,3
"1. UI is meesy and keeps changing. 2. Pictures are resized on thumbnails as they look big. Takes a while to open to see the whole picture. 3. Videos takes a while to load. 4. Feed suddenly scrolls back to the top. 5. Repetitive ads. Sometimes an ad is the first post on the feed. 6. Home feed doesn't seem to update or shows old posts, have to keep refreshing or go to Latest. 7. Can't categorize saved posts. Have to scroll for a saved post.",2023-07-02 14:47:42,1
"Like the other comments, this is with the most recent update, so anyone wanting to use this should hold off for a bit. Sometimes pictures/videos won't load, you can scroll up but the ""rules"" are weird. You can't scroll up while a video is playing, or if your finger is on the OP post/pinned mod comment trying to scroll, if that makes sense. The further down you are on Reddit, the less stable it becames until it freezes and/or crashes, so you can't actually spend a lot of time on the app.",2021-12-06 14:41:43,2
"They're overcomplicating a simple thing like playing a video. Now it's at the point where videos just don't play because it bugs up so easily. This app is so bloated and more complicated than it needs to be, just roll it back to the 2019 version and I'm sure everything will be perfect. The app even slows down when scrolling for 5 minutes. Not sure what's up with developers these days. From games to apps, everything is so bloated and resource hungry for even the most basic things.",2022-03-25 09:37:35,1
"Sub standard experience. It's not that I miss ""my old app"", I'm happy to change if needs be. But it's laking basic functionality that even the website has. Makes it almost unusable from a standard user point of view. Want to sort your home page? No chance. Change the view? No way. Video controls? No. Really quite rubbish, especially now that it's the only option.",2023-07-05 12:43:32,1
"Look I'm only giving it a 5 because I love reddit. In terms of actual usability, the app has lots of stability issues(it freezes and apparently heats up my phone somehow?), but the worst problem is the loading speed. When browsing the posts, the post itself loads fine but the comments take ages to load. Really would appreciate if you guys could fix this. Overall I love it but it has its issues that hopefully would be solved. Thank you so much",2019-03-25 05:02:29,5
"The app skips the actual post I clicked on to show me recommended posts under the comments. It doesn't seem like you can disable that feature. The account icon is now on the right, so that the menu accidentally opens when you scroll through posts. If you click on a video post from your home page, you can't scroll left to see the next post. You need to go back and click on a text/picture post to be taken out of the terrible video feed with videos that don't even play most of the time.",2022-03-09 10:20:16,1
"(Update) Alright, Reddit just freaking copies Tiktok now. Great. The video player was already bad, but now it's even worse. I would say, they shouldn't try to fix something that wasn't broken, but it was already broken... and this doesn't help. You can't pause vidoes without tapping on the video, and then tapping on the pause button, which is now in super uncomfortable place (right at the bottom left corner), and it's still just broken. It wouldn't play vidoes many times, and it's buggy as heck!",2022-03-12 10:26:29,1
"Reddit as a form of social media is amazing imo. But... There's this app. I've been using it for over a year, but recently it just became horrible. First was the video player just not playing anything no matter how much I tried, than the whole app just froze. I see the same error every time I open it. Tried uninstalling, switching accounts, restarting my phone etc. It honestly became a part of my daily routine, so i really hope it'll get fixed soon.",2022-02-03 12:58:41,2
"Have been using it for several years now. I don't mind the interface changes, but there's several very noticeable bugs that the developers have just neglected completely. I know Reddit has a fairly limited budget, so it makes sense that their app isn't as polished, but these are bugs that have been around for a long time that severely affect the user experience, and yet the development team keeps focusing on adding new features or changing the UI instead of just fixing them.. not great.",2023-03-13 22:26:53,1
"There's a persistent notification on the bottom right, making it look like you've received a message, but it's just the app reminding you to login (no, don't want to). After the recent update, loading GIFs seems to take longer than a second and freezes the app instead of allowing you to occupy yourself elsewhere while it loads. There's also no easy way for me to turn off the ""trending posts"" notification, which I absolutely do not care about. The ad to content ratio seems to have gone up to 1:3. Would recommend that you find another place to source your news from, since I don't think this.will improve.",2018-09-18 23:44:53,1
"It worked fine before, but when updated it a few days back, it kept on getting stuck. There is nothing but black background with blue reddit icon spinning for over ten mins. First i thought it was network problem, but it is not. Now ive tried it a few days later again but it still isnt loading when everything else that requires internet is working great. It will be great if you guys can fix this problem. Thank you!",2019-03-28 06:50:42,1
"Great overall experience with the app. One tiny, yet annoying, issue though: when i open the comment section of a post the app just crashes. It doesn't happen everytime but most of the time it does. I would be really glad if this got fixed (i am a smartphone user, i don't know if this happens on pc as well, even though i doubt it). Keep up the good work!",2019-01-15 00:30:59,4
"Coming from Boost, the official app is absolutely awful to use at its current state. Videos will not load properly, and the few that do load will keep buffering. When scrolling down the comments of a post, it will reset quite a few times, and in cases of high numbers of comments, leads me to start from the top again. Also, ads are knowingly masqueraded as posts, which takes up space on my home feed and the whole app eats up my data too quick. Fix it or expect lesser users in the near future.",2023-07-07 06:51:37,2
"Half the time after you view external content and want to go back to comment, the post list has refreshed without asking, and you're back at the start. You could scroll and hope the algorithm didn't sort it out, but good luck if you're not looking at a specific subreddit. But hey, at least there's a fresh set of ads to view! Which in my opinion is the real reason behind these changes. And let's not start on that video player...",2022-06-01 04:33:22,1
"App keeps locking up and crashing. Sometimes, it requires a complete uninstall and reinstall to get basic functionality like comments back. Additionally, there's issues like playing audio from one video over the audio of another or image sets failing to load at all.

"At some point I liked this app, but it seems the user experience becomes slightly worse every update. The biggest recent change is the UI for looking at posts with images. This change isn't bad in itself. However, it makes it impossible to read long images, and swiping right cycles through the posts vertically? The implementation feels off.. There's also something like a memory leak, and after a while of using the app it slows down to a crawl and crashes. Use a third-party app instead.",2023-02-10 22:14:47,1
"Ok, so I has to download this seeing as they killed RIF. it's one of the worst apps I've tried to use, the foldable version is non-existent and the functionality in general is so poor that it's hard to navigate in a place where there's literally just clicking a sub and scrolling down. From the very very poor optimisation to the videos not loading and still using data for 3-times as long as the video length.

It should be first time done. Ads are everywhere. I understand companies need to make money, but so, so many ads. I can't get to r/all. Doesn't exist in the app, no idea why. It isn't an easy to use app at all. Just don't bother. Move on from Reddit.",2023-06-30 23:24:51,1
"Far too many ads now. Every other 'post' is an ad and they're in all of the comments sections too. Sick and tired of everything becoming bloated with ads, it has ruined both YouTube and Reddit for me. Used to at least be able to block the ad accounts but now you can't, which means I keep seeing the same ads over and over again multiple times just by a rolling down the home page. It's pretty annoying, and makes me actually want to avoid buying the products. Will no longer be using this app.",2023-04-11 08:58:27,1
"Absolutely terrible app - usability is so bad! Simple things like favourite a subreddit you have to scroll through a massive list to find them. Creating & editing custom subreddit lists can't be done easily; you must go through so many hidden menus to edit the list. The whole app feels like an amateur, part-time grad student designed it because the usability is so amateurish and just plain bad. Why not copy the interface and features of one of the numerous 3rd party apps? They do it 10x better.",2023-09-23 00:24:18,1

Refresh button is useless and never actually refreshes anything, i could have the worlds best wifi and videos still wouldnt play anywhere above 144p, if they even play at all, the media player used by the app is an absolute trainwreck, and half the time when i try to post something i get an infinite ""we had some trouble getting to reddit"" and ""unable to upload post"" notification.

How hard is it to make a working video player for your app? Seriously. First the random freezes. Then the random black screens. Now this? Disappointing and makes me want to use other apps.",2022-08-12 03:32:55,1

And then when it does load it opens the same post 10 times because I kept clicking on it. I try refreshing or closing and opening the app multiple times a day, this is not user friendly!

"A lot of the app doesn't function well, even with the abundance of ads. The terrible part comes with their video player, it stops working after about the 3rd video it has loaded. You can get 3rd party apps that work better for loading Reddit videos, making them better than the official Reddit app. Since the new video system was introduced I have never known it to be good or work well...

New video player sucks really bad. You can't pause it or fast forward without going to full screen mode. It was awesome before this feature. What in the hell were your UX designers thinking. Return it to the previous state where you have to press a button to go full screen. This sucks. Also the videos are not loading propperly. And what's up with all the cache??,2021-12-04 12:07:57,1

I'm not on an old phone either- s22 ultra, where every other part of this phone is buttery smooth.",2023-03-07 12:30:49,1
"Pretty much the full reddit experience, like the online website. I particularly like the different displays on your main thread (which may end the old VS new reddit war), and that a few different ways are supported. Awards are of course a thing, but can be ignored most of the time and are not intrusive. Unfortunately it often happen that some features are broken (like the save shortcut in the menu when holding down on a thread for example atm), and image/video loading is often slow.",2021-01-17 08:44:09,4
"This app is horrible. I was using it for a while and it was fine, but update after update just killed it for me. I had to switch to a third party app last year because the official one was so slow to use. I'd have to restart it constantly because after reading 3 or so posts it would become unusably slow. I'd click on a post and it would take me somewhere completely different because it was taking so long to refresh. Now that third-party apps are dead, I'm afraid I'm not returning to Reddit.",2023-07-07 08:35:06,1
"Ironically, not the best app for reddit. It looks good and has a slick UI. However, performance was not the main objective. App hangs and sometimes even crashes. Videos don't load properly, this happens constantly. Is missing a few features from the desktop version, which would be OK if the performance wasnt horrible.",2021-01-17 10:40:59,2
"The app it terrible and it's been terrible for years (across multiple phones). App always gets stuck loading the main feed. Doesn't matter if you close the app, force close the app or restart your phone, it just doesn't work sometimes. Also, you can't turn off the ads anymore. I have little hope that this app will ever get better. Just worse.",2023-10-18 14:21:38,1
"The bugs have been around FOR YEARS. It's getting ridiculous. Fix the app. It takes literally 5 to 10 minutes to be able to open a post. Often, the feed just doesn't load. Been like this for ages without anyone fixing it. And it's getting worse. Instead we get bs features like real-time interaction blah blah, nobody actually believes those numbers are real. If the main issue gets fixed, it's a great app.",2023-02-08 08:29:02,1
"Although I love Reddit, the app is trash. I hate that it refreshes the page if you close the app and open it again and you lose all the scrolling process. The same happens with the reddit icon on the bottom left of the screen. It needs some sort of confirmation to avoid accidental taps. But mostly I hate of how long the videos and gifs buffer. So annoying, fix them please! EVERYONE IS COMPLAINING!",2018-11-11 03:15:04,2
"Major issues with the app. Data consumption is a runaway nightmare. Chat functionality doesn't have proper notifications. There is no way to switch between chat and the rest of Reddit if you opened a notification. The app is heavily buggy and even after closing the application, it often would not load Reddit, and would only work after doing a reset of the phone. This is a multi billion dollar company. Your app should work as well as if not better than the website.",2018-09-18 01:45:11,1
Don't like the new forced discover channels notifications on chat. Please make this go away. I don't even use chat if I don't have to,2024-02-17 17:35:18,2
"Even after you killed the third-party apps, I still stayed. It wasn't enough to make me uninstall, but I guess you finally managed to do it. Extremely buggy and glitchy. 90% of the time you open a post and it goes to a black screen. When you finally are able to check a post, the comment doesn't load. You go back from the post and the entire feed reloads. You lose everything you were trying to see....Including when you get a black screen, so if the post doesn't load on the first try, good luck",2023-10-22 10:10:57,1
"Everything loads very slowly, and the app is constantly shoving popups in your face to turn on certain features. No way to turn these off, you can only temporarily dismiss them. Can't view top posts of all time because it just won't load. Search bar is confusing. Poor UX, can't view a user's profile because the button isn't their name but is rather their user icon, which is tiny.",2023-07-19 07:59:28,2
"Won't give it more until they fix the crashing. It happens I would say maybe once or twice an hour, and between the crashes it freezes mid scroll and you have to wait for it to unfreeze or just give up, close the app and start all over from the top of the page. Some videos won't buffer at all, some plays a few seconds and then freezes and won't play no matter what you try. Pictures sometimes doesn't load and overall the app is a mess in it's current state",2018-12-17 13:02:20,3
"Full of bugs! It's not even the lack of features that made me uninstall this, but the fact that even the most basic stuff like scrolling is a nightmare: the feed is sluggish, sometimes refreshes randomly and even loses your scroll position. It's absurd. You would think a company of this size would be able to build a functional app, but this is a disaster.",2023-07-01 02:18:06,1
"Dreadful. No tablet or foldable support. UI is awful. Unable to set where links open such as an external browser. Most media doesn't include audio despite the source having audio. Media quality is always poor. Constant notification requests. For an official app that now needs to replace all of the good third party ones, it's a failure. It has already put me off using the Reddit, and I imagine there's a large and silent majority in the same position.",2023-07-13 16:47:27,1
"App sticks and stutters a lot on my 1 year old flagship device whenever I'm scrolling. The text is super tiny and it hurts my eye to read. There's no way to set your own custom font, font size or background color - this should be a high priority feature given that a lot of people read a lot of reddit threads. Finally, there's so much ads that it distracts from the experience.",2023-07-02 23:34:20,1
"It's got even worse. The video player is so messed up. 1 - the videos randomly won't play anymore. 2 - whenever you click on a video's comments it will full screen the comment section, play the video behind it even (even if you paused it) and you're unable to change this. 3 - routing is horrible if you're trying to go to comment history for example",2022-06-12 06:33:18,1
"It's a decent app. Some bugs I had issues with, like videos with audio not having audio or the feed just not loading. I think there was something else that bugged me, but have forgotten since I moved to Boost a little while ago. The reason for 2 stars is the bug that does not allow me to view my followers. Was hoping to be able to determine whether to allow them to continue or block them. Will change rating once the bug is addressed.",2022-03-06 14:24:03,2
"Love it and the traditional threaded message view (non Gmail style) makes it easy to follow and interact on a specific conversation. Keep up the good work. My only wish is for it to have a better way to continue reading unread/new messages, when you relaunch the app. eg: Like my email client (Thunderbird) show any new messages in Bold text. I find it very annoying not knowing where I left off in a discussion.",2020-07-23 22:36:06,4
"I only installed this app for the chat, because everything else is done better by other reddit apps. Sadly the chat is completely broken. It doesn't let you open links (breaks URLs and doesn't let you use an external proper browser), doesn't shown new messages in the chat even though it showed notifications about them, sometimes just keeps sending your last message over and over again until you ""force stop"" via Android settings. It doesn't let you select and copy messages, it doesn't even let you send pictures and if you upload to imgur instead and want to send the link, it breaks the link, and many many more problems. It's like they actually tried to make it as bad and unusable as possible.",2018-10-06 15:58:15,1
"The experience is super bad. Makes the word experience have a bad connotation to it. Any 3rd party client(Sync, Relay, Boost, redreader, etc) is infinitely better than this trash of an excuse for the app. The video player is laggy, it can not turn landscape, and the feed is too much cluttered you can barely see the posts as they are. The comments are no different. Unfortunately, this trash will be default experience in a month or so. Uninstall is what i recommend.",2023-06-05 14:18:45,1
"Reddit itself is great, but the app started getting on my nerves since the last update that was released about a week ago. It gets laggy and often freezes when I'm scrolling through posts. It's definitely not my phone. For some reason the spacing between paragraphs is different from when you post via desktop. Even if I post via mobile and then check the same post/reply on my desktop I can see there's a clear difference in spacing. A minor issue really, but would be nice to have consistency.",2021-11-28 17:57:27,3
"It's a really good app and i love it ..... On the other hand, there's tons of bugs yet to be fixed. First being when i clicked on a video, the video doesn't seem to play at all, so i only got to look at the thumbnail. Second is actually a feature to be added: to reduce data consumption (U might wanna consider this or make a lighter version of Reddit as it will be much of a need for many people like myself).",2022-02-07 11:27:45,4
"I just want to point out that the new video interface is much worse than before. To the point I spend 80% less time on Reddit. The save button is not accessible in one click, swiping up doesn't close the video but shows others from the same sub, why change the function of an input instead of adding the option to swipe to the side to see other videos ? Muscle memory gets me everytime and I get annoyed. No play button in the middle of the screen anymore. Why fix something that isn't broken ?",2021-12-15 14:41:02,2
"Nothing wrong with the service reddit. This app is just very poorly made. A mixture of poor design choices and bugs makes it hard to browse for long periods of time. If you're going to browse reddit, just do it on your computer. If you don't have a computer or just want to browse on your phone, I recommend reddit boost. It's very well designed and doesn't share any of the flaws the offical reddit app has.",2020-03-26 08:03:02,2
"This app would be great if it didn't start freezing and crashing after I browse for more than 20 minutes. It starts to chug, running slower and slower, until eventually the whole thing just locks up. Clearing the cache and restarting it doesn't help. The video player suffers, too. I don't know what's causing this issue but it makes it really hard to enjoy browsing Reddit through this app.",2020-10-15 22:24:08,2
"App is fine, but there are a few things that frustrate the heck out of me sometimes. - Videos and GIFs randomly change quality and there is no way to select your preferred quality (if there is, you can't change it quickly) - Sometimes getting into and exiting out of a post takes you to a solid black screen for a good few seconds before it snaps out of it. - There is no way to format text (bold, underline, etc.) when you're making a post.",2020-01-21 09:54:52,3
"As of a few updates ago the app has beome completely unusable for me. Videos and comments randomly stop loading. Uploading photos and videos is a hassle. It gives an error message, saying the upload failed, and it takes 5 or 6 tries sometimes for it to spontaneously work. Same goes with videos. When I try to upload to a subreddit, it says the post was submitted, but the uploading never actually happened. It has become incredibly frustrating, and I've uninstalled the app.",2023-07-09 07:24:15,1
"I've been using the Reddit Android app for a long time now and it just keeps getting worse. It's slow, clunky, and always seems to be full of bugs - even on the latest high-end chipsets. Videos never seem to play properly either. I really hope Reddit can optimise their app better so that we can actually use it without having to rely on supercomputers!",2023-06-16 23:42:40,1
"The worst way to use Reddit. Slow, sluggish and laggy. It uses a considerable amount of Data and is the only app on my phone that noticeably drains the battery like there's no tomorrow. My feed is full of Ads, Promoted Posts and Suggested Posts, leaving little room for the Subs that I actually follow and care about. The design is busy and unclear. It's poor from an accessibility perspective. There are numerous third-party Apps that are significantly better in every regard.",2023-06-09 10:50:08,1
"Love reddit, but last few updates have made the app almost unusable. It is slow to respond so it doesn't scroll or select the right thing constantly. It takes a long time to load posts/comments to the point of freezing and crashing multiple times a day. The video player is trash, won't load videos properly at all. Videos are automatically full screened when tapped and you have to select the comments, unlike a normal post where you scroll. Lots of little things too, but these are the main issues",2022-09-14 16:46:06,1
"The interface in the browser is much better. What annoys me to no end with this app is that if you long press a post it collapses. I always scroll slowly while reading and it happens all the time, that I put my finger on the display to scroll, but don't move it right away or move it very slowly and boom.. The post I happened to put my finger on collapses. Terrible design.",2018-12-18 12:01:38,2
"Most videos don't play despite fast internet. There is no way to return to previous scroll position if you back press accidentally. Mobile website is far better than app. Edit : I was getting used to this app and they went an extra mile. Now with new update, the app is unusable. It takes forever to load images. Doesn't show images when you tap on them and opens the entire thread instead. Many times, I am just left refreshing with nothing showing up. Worst app ever.",2023-05-23 17:12:44,1
"Recent update has turned an app that was okay, but with room for improvement, into a steaming pile of digital garbage. The changes to the video player are truly awful - I don't want the video playing on continuous loop while I read comments in the bottom half of the screen, I want to be able to read the comments separately. Also, the spoiler text function doesn't seem to work anymore - tapping it doesn't reveal the text. Increasingly laggy in general, too. Reverse these poor changes please.",2021-07-14 13:02:36,2
It's a good app however I've only recently found out that in the settings when you turn off location tracking and information usage from partners that when you scroll back up to the top of the settings and back down they are turned back on making turning these off impossible. There isn't a save settings button or anything like that in settings. very shady stuff,2020-07-13 06:45:29,1
"The video player is awful. It won't load the actual video 80% of the time, and the new UI is awful. Whenever I click to play the video it takes up my entire screen and takes me to the comment section. Also, sometimes, because of this new UI I can't scroll down in the comments or click anything on it. The app crashes repeatedly, you can't click the buttons on the UI if you've been through a chain of links, EVERYTHING is awful. Download Reddit booster for a better experience.",2022-03-15 14:20:25,1
"The news update is so bad, I had to come and update my review. The video player is super unintuitive and has enough differences from the old one that it's annoying to use (not to mention there was nothing wrong with the old one). For example, there is no longer a way to see how long the video is in the preview. You have to full screen the video for it. I'd like to know how much time I'm gonna waste before I commit. Granted it's really trivial little details but it's the fact that Reddit went out",2022-02-05 12:41:08,3
"The Reddit Android app falls short of expectations. It's consistently laggy, making navigation a chore. Ads are intrusive and frequent, disrupting the user experience. The algorithm fails to recommend relevant posts and subreddits, often missing the mark. The UI is unintuitive, complicating even simple tasks. Overall, a disappointing experience that makes alternative Reddit clients a more appealing choice. Doesn't even support multireddits...",2023-10-01 14:33:31,1
"I liked the app. Constant UI changes didn't really bother me that much. I liked or wasn't bothered by most new features. It was easy to use. All until the new video thing. It takes out of the whole browsing experience. I use light UI theme, but just to view the video the whole app, including comments turns dark. The feel and controls are very TikTok-like and it just feels so out of place. The controls are weird. I wish there was a way to revert older version of the app. :(",2022-02-07 22:05:18,2
"When it's working, the app is generally quite great. Most of the time however, it repeatedly crashes or freezes and the app has to close within 10 minutes of use. I've reinstalled the app tens of times. Also, the app has an annoying feature when scrolling through. The app will sometimes 'refresh' and take you right back to the top and you have to start back over. This is really annoying when searching for specific posts as you lose where you had found them.",2019-12-21 14:42:28,2
"Getting worse with every update. Reddit is planning on killing third-party Apps, but the official App lags, is full of annoying Ads and lacks a lot of features. Recently, Reddit removed the option to configure the default sorting of the home feed. I prefer ""Latest"", but now I have to change the view manually every time I start the App. They clearly don't care about their users.",2023-06-06 05:14:52,1
"On the whole though a great app for information, entertainment, world news and communicating problems or just meeting new people. However the biggest issue I have at the moment is for some reason I have an issue of starting chats, I've seen a few users comllain about this but a fix needs to be sorted as it's very irritating. I've tried logging out and back in, uninstalling and reinstalling and even restarting my phone but nothing works. Please work a fix for this please!!",2022-11-14 23:16:44,3
"The app concept is great. I downloaded it because a lot of people use it including my friends. As soon as I opened it, I was very confused. The system if very buggy. It dosent let me follow my friends, the video player is horrific for me. I tried unInstalling, and installing it again, restarting my phone and nothing changed. Overall I would've rated it a lot higher if it was easier to use.",2022-08-25 20:46:00,1
"This app is absolutely chock full of bugs and memory leaks. One problem that CONSISTENTLY drives me insane is when I click on a post, and the post that shows up is a different post from a different community. This happens all over the app. Beyond that, using the app for longer than 5 minutes can result in a crash more often than not, preceded by freezes, stuttering and sometimes flashing. It's a shame because the UI is awesome, but the app hasn't been stable for many months now.",2023-02-28 09:24:15,1
"The App is good but it can be better. Especially the video player. I use this App on a daily basis, so being able to view video's without having to download them would be great; since I can go back and rewatch a video I bookmarked. And that would be a whole lot more convenient instead of downloaded videos taking up device storage. The lake of sound also throws me off on videos that do play. But ultimately I enjoy the easy accessibility and availability of content, as well as safety regulations.",2022-03-27 03:45:57,4
"The app works well, but for some reason the development team continues to make unnecessary and unneeded changes, such as moving the ""Sort by"" button to settings and switching the sides of the profile view panel from left to right. Nothing too terrible, but I find it VERY annoying and frustrating. Furthermore, it seems that with every update the devs are hellbent on making the ui even worse. If it ain't broke, don't fix it...",2023-03-05 14:48:37,1
"The thing is that I would like to use the official app, but it just doesn't worked properly. The endless scrolling feature often fails, especially if you want see the comments (which is half the fun). Also, the video player continuously fails as well. Suddenly you just end up with empty black boxes. If you're going to make the mobile website version purposefully annoying, then at least make the app actually function.",2022-06-08 04:17:08,1
"The app is ok-ish, however I have a few problems with it. 1. The video player is terrible. Many times, the video is being played on low-quality for no reason. Sometimes it doesnt play the video at all. 2. The refresh feature is more of an annoyance than it is useful. PLEASE, just limit the refresh feature to only one gesture instead of the return button on my phone, like why would I waste a minute scrolling back towards something I missed?",2020-09-18 09:20:50,3
"Littered with ads, missing basic quality of life features, anti competition, slow, buggy, and unreliable. Accessibility for vision impaired people is virtually non existent so if you have vision problems, you're better off going with any of a large number of third party apps for Reddit.

"Okay, so there's now a hidden setting that allows the app to track your location to cater advertising that you cannot turn off. YOU CANNOT TURN OFF THIS APP TRACKING YOUR LOCATION. If you turn off the setting allowing it, it literally turns it back on the moment you leave the screen. This is the most subversive thing I have ever seen. Absolutely reprehensible.",2020-07-13 05:05:34,1
"It does what it's supposed to: let you browse reddit. But beyond that, it lacks some basic functionality that the full site supports (especially with regards to formatting).

"Countless times, the app glitches and doesn't refresh when I'm hecking in on a subreddit I'm subscribed to. It got so bad one subreddit was months behind. More often than not, I just sign in online which sucks since the UI is worse. Terrible product! Quit telling me to go check something out in the app, if the app won't work! I'm uninstalling and reinstalling. If that doesn't work, I don't know what will!",2022-08-30 02:20:15,1
"The new video player isn't as simple to use as the previous one, you can't just pause a video by tapping it anymore, and -because it also takes care of gifs- gifs don't loop anymore but they still autoplay, too bad if you missed its first seconds; and it also forces dark mode onto you, which I ain't really a fan of. Links to social media posts don't open them in-app either anymore. Some quality of life issues that can be easily fixed I believe",2022-02-08 11:50:23,2
"Slow, filled with ads, and not focused. The app is disorganised: shows my subreddits randomly (versus what's popular), no filtering options, a whole button made for posting, but Reddit isn't a social network, so that space is useless. The layout feels like it's a cheap mix between Instagram and Tiktok, whereas the content doesn't match what the app is designed for. I tried using it for a few days, but don't feel like it's showing me what I want to see.",2023-06-06 16:28:30,1
"It does all the expected things, but it's a bit buggy. For example, scrolling up the app seems to think you want to refresh, no matter the speed you attempt to scroll at and instead means you can only scroll a few lines at a time. Some things take more taps than needed: like viewing someone's profile. I want to see their other posts straight away, the little pop-up is not useful. I can't even follow them from it.",2021-12-06 10:50:52,3
"I like Reddit. Except for many problems I am experiencing on the app that make me never want to use it again. Firstly, everytime I am scrolling through my feed by swiping sideways, videos will play even though I am not viewing them yet. It is frustrating as it often jumpscares me when it begins playing out loud. Another problem I face is videos not being able to pause until I refresh the post then the option finally shows up. It's frustrating and often has multiple videos audio playing at once.",2021-03-23 23:16:17,3
"Doesn't function even on a basic level. Videos are often unplayable, the client performance is bad, the functionality leaves a lot to be desired, bad ads. Luckily third-party apps fix a lot of these issues, but Reddit has decided to kill those on July 1st. While this app is SO FAR behind in functionality compared to third-party apps. I guess Reddit wants all the ""telemetry"" and serve ads. Sad to see. Don't use it in it's current state",2023-06-04 17:56:00,1
Reddit ran fine and was really good until recently. I'm not sure what happened but I've had a number of bugs pop up. The first is not being able to scroll up when I click into a post and look at the comments. When I scroll up it reloads rather than scrolls up and the page is locked in place. The second bug is it's been VERY laggy and half the time I can't even use it because nothing loads and I get the 'try again' button. The audio also plays in the background even if I'm not clicked in a video.,2021-12-30 10:20:46,1
"It's Reddit, i don't have any issues with the Ui, i think everything is well placed, intuitive and the application is pretty fun to use and easy to use. When it doesn't crash that is. I can hardly use this application for more than 5 minutes before it crashes these past weeks and it's terribly irritating. It isn't an instant crash, it slows down, freezes, freezes my phone and than crash after a minute or two. My phone isn't a power beast, but it shouldn't have to be for application like this.",2020-08-13 21:35:56,2
"It worked completely fine a year ago. But recently they have been making it worse by the day. The UI is constantly changing, almost daily at this point, between different versions. Sometimes there are even different versions when I switch between profiles! And there are so many bugs, my main one si that sometimes the chat just doesn't allow you to send pictures at all. It worked completely fine a year ago, and I don't know why the ruined it",2023-03-10 18:32:00,2
"Nothing loads. No comments, no new posts, forget about opening anything from notifications. It's practically unusable in it's current state. I have to have reddit loaded in my phone's browser to be able to use it on the phone, and somehow even putting up with the constant reminder to ""open in the app"" taking up 1/2 my screen it's still miles more user friendly. Please give us a functional android app!",2019-04-14 22:22:23,1
App has gotten SO slow and buggy to the point it takes more than 30 seconds for a post to load. the the timeline is fine but the moment I click on a post I can go to the bathroom and back and still be waiting for stuff to load. audio doesn't properly play on the video player when it works fine on desktop. makes for a very unenjoyable experience. my phone is not old and all my other apps work fine.,2022-08-02 00:23:35,1
"This review is mainly about the app, the site itself is good, except for the horrible video player. Often the main page just stops working, as of now it keeps throwing an error for a few days already (reason for only 2 stars).

"There are significantly better alternative apps to access Reddit, this app fails to meet many functional requirements which is necessary to use the site. Other alternative apps have significantly better performance, stability, working videos, accessibility features, moderation tools and many more.

Reddit is also making a malicious move to charge other apps to access and use their API.",2023-06-05 15:52:36,1
"The app itself is great however they have a really weird way of forcing content on users that is a deal breaker. I came across this feature called live stream since it was on my feed. I didn't care much for it so I chose the show less of this option. That option is buggy because I have seen it on my feed multiple times after. It should be an opt in feature - not forced upon users!! I contacted customer support twice and was met with a half hearted, unprofessional reply or no response at all.",2020-06-23 02:22:46,1
When the app actually works it's by far the best Reddit app. Unfortunately it is WILDLY inconsistent. About 2 or 3 times a month it will literally stop functioning for a few hours. About 10 to 20 times per day videos won't load. Sometimes it will just play the audio from a looping clip (when they actually do load) forever until you force close the app. Going to look for alternatives now so that I can actually watch video clips since they are consistently broken on this app.,2023-05-11 21:40:38,1
It's a pretty good app to view content from a large amount commuties. Two problems I havewith the app is uploading. At least over half the time I have some sort of problem when I'm uploading. It also doesn't tell you why you couldn't upload so you usually left guessing what the problem could is. The second problem is the post load speed you could have ideal internet conditions and reddit would still find a way to take hours to load a post. This is usually almost always the case for videos.,2020-12-09 17:00:00,3
"One of the worst apps in terms of user experience. Bugs are not just happening once or twice but at every single interaction with the app. Want to open the comments, they do not load. Want to pause a video running in the background, it instead full screens it. You pause video sounds , they play randomly. Search function is scuffed, its easier to search on google and put reddit at the end of the search than using the actual app. Its a 500 word limit and i cannot say more",2023-06-29 07:24:45,1
"Truly useless. Every single app extension was better in every way, but they're now all paywalled. It is a slow, clunky experience where viewing a single image takes actual minutes to load. It's as if they're trying to make a bad product in some 4D chess game that nobody else understands. Impossible to browse, search, post, or really use the app for anything it was intended for. No wonder this company is losing money.",2023-10-25 22:04:17,1
"The official Reddit app is too slow. Randomly changes settings, a lot of bugs and ads. Interface is confusing and lacks a lot of features, even for impaired people. The way out is using third-party apps to access Reddit. These third-party apps are way more fast, clean, customizable and feature-packed than the official Reddit app. But recently Reddit is killing these third-party apps, all in the name of the profit. Better choose other app.",2023-06-14 21:06:58,1
"I usually don't leave reviews, but this one deserves all the bashing it gets. Like many out there, I've been forced to come back to the official Reddit app from a third party client. The app lags horribly, scrolling is too choppy. It makes the phone warm and consumes more battery. All this for an app that is just bare bones compared to the third party clients. The video player is just bad. There's no native text formatting. They need to get their act together and sort out this app.",2023-07-22 04:26:43,1
"Falls flat in comparison to Sync for Reddit, before the API changes, using Reddit via Sync was an absolute joy, everything worked like a dream (had very little issues and ran smoothly), and the customization/UX was sane and beautiful. In contrast, the customization is there, but the UX sucks, lag everywhere and the app chokes on anything you do with it that you expect from other 3rd party apps, shameful. Yet another company competing on whom can make the worst cross-platform build...",2023-07-02 01:15:41,1
"Reddit on phone is one of the single most miserable experiences. Constant freezes, content not loading (with perfectly good Wi-Fi), infinite scrolling works when it feels like it. I could go on and on. However the nail in the coffin is the fact that the reddit webpage forcefully directs you to the app (or the store to download it) if you try to open it on mobile from the browser.",2019-06-03 08:41:59,2
"Coming from sync, this app is a joke. Usability is near zero, gestures are all over the place (sometimes its to exit, sometimes it shows the next image). No support for multi groups, barely any options for changing the look (just cards and classic), no themes, when you blur NSFW images the post suddenly become smaller... The save button is not next to the up/downvote buttons, stupid emojis and wierd award animations are everywhere... There's no consistency in this app.",2023-07-01 08:48:09,1
The notifications are out of control. Constant spam (yes I've tried to change the settings) Really hard to navigate. It's not unusual to have to click back many times just to see the home button again. And why can't you just open the app at the time page???? Really cluttered and hard to read UI. Massive downgrade from Reddit is Fun Went from constantly accessing Reddit to barely using it at all. Well done.,2023-07-16 11:22:53,1
"Painful to use. Honestly, using reddit on your mobile browser might just be more tolerable. It's slow, stutters, has weird glitches where elements overlap. Their video players are horrendous and glitchy. I've had so many issues uploading videos and images, and I end up having to reupload them. There's very little customisation. I can't really think of anything good to say.",2023-06-29 22:07:57,1
"The video player doesn't load 1 of every 3 videos I open. I have lately noticed how the CEO of Reddit abuses his powers to manipulate users; lack of transparency is not something I like. Very slow platform, takes way too long to load images (1 of every 7-8 images doesnt load) and 60% of the time, comments won't load. Cannot use screen readers. Cannot stop getting bombarded with inappropriate and annoying ads which I cannot specialize. The interface is bad as well.",2023-06-10 01:03:53,1
"Used to be quite good, but with the recent update they made the already abominable video player even more abominable. It's comically bad, you'll try to watch a video, but it won't play, you press the play button and it just straight up doesn't work at all. The sound doesn't work half the time, either, not to mention how a video you tried to play 5 minutes ago suddenly start playing with the sound on out of nowhere.",2022-03-23 10:18:54,1
"Love the app, works great almost... The issue I'm experiencing is the video that is on the next post (off screen) will start to play resulting in random music and sounds. The video cannot be stopped unless you scroll down and then back up again. This is the most annoying issue I've experienced as I'll be watching one video and another video below it will start to also play so there will be two sounds/music but one video. Given the content on Reddit, this is sometimes extremely confusing!!",2021-11-18 11:49:42,3
"The app itself is filled with crazy, toxic people. Fair enough, that's fine, I'm used to Discord, Tumblr, Deviantart, ect. I tried making a post on the website, but when I tried it asked about my username, I said to keep it and it came up as saved! However, everytime I tried to make a post the same notification would pop up, but no matter what I pressed it would tell me ""your username cannot be changed"" even though I pressed No, Keep Username multiple times.",2021-03-24 04:53:00,1
"This app is just a mobile browser reskinned, opening Reddit in your browser of choice would probably be the same or better. Additionaly there is no landscape mode, no dual pane, NSFW is on autoplay by default???, no tablet mode, can't resize text size, can't resize list size (its large cards or a large sized list showing 5-6 posts at a time???), super slow loading and constant ""let's try that again, there was an error loading content"" then you lose scroll position. How can it be this bad.",2023-07-01 23:42:10,1
"Bloated, unintuitive, not many options for customization, worst shorts-video type of a player i've seen. If there are more.pics in one post, the number indicator turns invisible too fast. Everything costs more clicks to do anything than before, no option to unmark read post, small filtering option in search, can't download video (why? how come every other client could do this?), can't share video or image straight from the app by caching it. It lags and bugs a lot, when i wanted to post something with images, after 10 minutes of trying to get through the too-many clicks interface, i finnally managed to upload the post, but it uploaded completely different images?!",2023-07-06 17:34:38,1
"My god does this app work badly. The site itself is fine but in this app it struggles to load just about everything. Today it gets stuck on a fully black screen making me unable to even open individual posts. It has always been slow at loading them but this is a new low. I do not have a bad or old phone by any means either, this is purely an optimization issue (or should I say disaster). The video player is also barely functional, sometimes not at all.",2023-09-01 07:13:01,1
"Why do you keep updating and ""improving"" things that are perfectly fine? The new video player is awful. If I tap on the video then I just want to see the duration or skip in, it's very rare that I actually want to see the video in full screen. After going to the comments I now have to go back twice instead of once because of the new video player and it's annoying to get used to. Opening comments is often bugged as it skips down to suggested posts instead of showing me the comments.",2022-02-27 14:30:50,2
Less options would benefit streamlining. Helpful platform for individuals seeking information.,2024-03-01 15:25:18,4
More than half the gifs with sound don't play with sound. Confusing button placements where the top three dots on the top right does different things based on if the post is fullscreen or not. For example download is available only fullscreen not in the feed. Opposite for save. Most of the subs I've subscribed to don't ever show up in my home feed (even on the desktop). No idea what's up with that. And the frequency of ads has noticeably increased where almost every third post is an ad.,2023-08-26 12:58:01,2
"Man I love this app. It really tests my patience. So now comments work again, but videos don't load half the time and then the app just crashes every five or so swipes. The back button action is also completely inconsistent making you lose whatever you were doing. When you do remember what it was, there's no way looking it back up because the search functionality is just nonexistent.",2022-09-07 08:55:03,1
"The Reddit app is unable to turn into landscape mode. I wonder if their developers have ever noticed, that tablets are difficult to hold in portrait mode...?? also, the app is difficult to handle: even simple things such as copying text is sometimes not possible: just try to copy the message that starts a thread.... in the end I have to revert to the web version. But editing messages on the web version is so buggy....",2022-12-04 13:36:23,1
This app sucks. It has more adds than third party Reddit apps that you can't remove the images from. This means when I'm browsing through the sub I have my smaller tiles for the content I want and then a huge ad with a big picture that takes up most of the screen until i scroll past it. It doesn't always work and it feels like it's trying to look cool rather than work functionally. I am going to miss third party Reddit apps like RiF (Reddit is Fun) or Apollo on my iPad next month.,2023-06-12 12:46:38,1
"Mobile app is but a fraction of the PC browser version, harder to navigate, laggy when clicking on any content that isn't an ad. Not to mention videos are a hit or miss if they decide to play at all... Id steer clear of this app and only use the PC browser version. Been using this app for 5 years now, felt like I wasted a bunch of time on it...",2023-06-29 16:55:32,1
"Unfortunately the app has several performance issues and its usability is severely diminished by bad design. Videos rarely load properly if at all. The main page needs several refreshes until the posts you click on actually sync with the posts you see on the page. Imagine clicking on a nice cat pic to see it in more detail but instead you clicked on a story-time text post instead, because of the desync. Overall the experience on this app is rather bad. Use the browser or another app if you can.",2023-06-17 09:22:49,2
"Buggy. If you use the app for more than 15 mins it becomes unusable and non responsive until you force quit and clear the cache. Video playback is plagued with issues. The absolute WORST right now is the random playback of ads and videos when scrolling through the feed. Even whe. There's no ad present and sometimes it's impossible to stop, or mute this. Stick with the website the app is not worth the hassle!",2020-10-20 09:03:26,1
"I mainly browse reddit on phone. Back then browser experience was bad & I found the app has some good features. But now they're both the same, bad load times with vids/gif & adding unnecessary features as the company focuses more on revenue; it's understandable but in exchange of the UX quality. I really wanted to just let go of this but unfortunately for me this is one of the best social media to get inconspicuous & specific info. I hope there can be a better alternative or a new competitor.",2023-06-30 12:12:09,1
"It's reddit, but in worse. Can't open multiple tabs, harder to navigate in the comments, use more battery, can't open link in your browser, can't copy text... What's use of this app? (We all know. It's to collect your data and shows ads because you can't refuse them in the app) And it REALLY tiresome that they try to make you to go on the app EVERY TIME when you are on the site.",2023-08-17 22:30:12,1
"I used to like Reddit and the content there. However, this app is absolutely terrible. It lags, crashes, turns my phone into a small space heater, and worst of all it, autoplays audio for ads that aren't even on my screen! I was considering scaling back my usage of Reddit in general, but the inconvenience of the app has swiftly accelerated my departure from the service. As a tech/internet brand, Reddit should be ashamed at the user experience of their android app. I wish I could give 0 stars.",2020-10-16 18:46:01,1
"The app seems amazing, but looks can be deceivng. Each update has made it worse and worse over the past year or so. It's like seeing an image with a play button on it. You try to press play over and over until you realize you've been bamboozled, nothing happens just like with this app. You open it, half the time nothing loads, the embedded videos rarely work, the comments load incrementally, and now the subreddits don't even work. Each update seems worse than the previous version.",2019-04-15 04:28:31,1

There was the issue a few weeks back when you couldn't scroll up anymore, took ages to be fixed, only to be replaced by random loading of different posts...",2022-02-03 21:56:23,1
"This app is amazing for general news and staying about to date with almost anything. There is one complaint from my side as I've contacted support on many different occasions, but haven't received a response on the matter. This took place after I purchase 19-20 USD worth of reddit coins, but didn't receive them. I must say the late (None at all) response time from there support won't effect many users as you'll rarely find yourself having the need to contact them as most transactions go smoothly and the app has the least amount of bugs I've seen on a Android app.",2018-12-16 11:54:18,4
"Horrible app compared to third party clients. Doesn't load your subreddits. A lot of ads and tracking. Pictures never show full screen at first but are cut off so you have to click on them. It's a complicated mess that's specifically made to track the user and provide sponsored content, not give a good user experience, which is odd since they bought out an actually good app and refuses to use it.",2023-06-09 09:06:49,1
"I was forced to switch from a 3rd party app but thought I would give this the benefit of the doubt and try it out. Unfortunately it is CONSTANTLY broken. It won't let me into subs for no reason at all, it randomly won't load content, it periodically freaks out and freezes. It's a mess. On top of that the options to curate your home feed are dismal. I miss RIF, which actually consistently worked.",2023-10-19 21:47:49,1
"I can't see a full video. Takes forever to load. Looks like a lot going on at the same time on the App and it kinda freezes. Videos takes a long time to load,especially the really interesting ones🤔 Also I cancel my subscription, Way to high price. The Karma coins is free every 5 days,so I just have to use those! The App is interesting, not bad...",2022-09-09 01:25:17,3
"Hate to give bad rating but I regret updating with the newest update. 1. The video being a pop-up and opening in a separate screen is bothering and worse than the way it was before. Sometimes it plays in the background while being in a totally different post and that's annoying. I'd be great if you return the older way of watching videos back. 2. The previous update introduced the ability to not only sort posts by ""hot"" or ""top"" but also to specify the date range- that's gone also sadly",2022-02-06 13:06:15,1
"please just stop messing with it... The video player is a wind up, volume now works years after they broke it which is nice, but hiding posts doesn't work and everything shows no matter what you do. The front page has had the option to sort removed, so I can no longer order by the top for the week, it's all just the latest ""stuff"" that I ""might like"". If I refresh the content just keeps changing. SHOW ME THE TOP STUFF I FOLLOW AND STOP MESSING WITH THE SYSTEM",2023-01-09 09:34:56,2
"It's great when it works. The videos are playable, it's easy to tell when you get free awards, etc. And then there comes that one day when you get the dreaded ""We had some trouble getting to Reddit"" message that never goes away and removes all functionality that this app has. I wish this problem (whatever it may be) gets fixed.",2021-04-16 22:17:45,3
"9/10 times when I decide to use the app, nothing loads. Connection errors constantly. Instead of fixing it they just stuff the app full of ads. Platform itself is great, but the app just stops loading or is down almost every time I use it. And if it doesn't, it stops loading posts after a while, or loads them on a black screen and never continues.",2021-11-21 18:24:26,1
"Often buggy and inconvenient to use (can't copy text, for example). Doubly annoying that clicking on Reddit links in a mobile browser always results in a game of, ""Are you REALLY sure you don't want to use our broken, inefficient application?"" Note that even positive reviews mention how often the app crashes/bugs out. We all know Reddit itself is fine, it's just this app that makes the experience painful.",2020-01-10 01:53:09,2
"Horrible app. It worked for one day, then it froze when loading videos, after which it froze loading images and at the end just opening the app made it freeze until Android allowed me to kill the process. Clearing cache and all data doesn't do the job, neither clearing the phone's memory (And I have 8GB of RAM available when I open this app only). Uninstalling and reinstalling it doesn't work, as it will freeze even when asking me to log in.",2021-09-20 15:54:24,1
"I am very disappointed in the app. It used to be a good companion in keeping a person busy with various articles, but lately, it seems that a lot of the pages have gone offline for one or the other reason.

"The recent update has made viewing videos, and reading the posts associated with them, a hideous experience. Previously I'd swipe up to dismiss a video the same as I do with pictures. Now instead of dissmising the video, a new random video pops up in its place. Also, when I click to read the comments on a video post, the text changes from my normal black text on white background to white text on black. This is unacceptable, I'm deleting the app in favour of a 3rd party app provider.",2022-02-07 22:22:49,1
"I dont want to be forced to waste internal storage on an app JUST to browse the site. It doesn't even work properly when trying to run it from browser apps on desktop mode, so the reddit app is pretty much mandatory. When browsing from a PC there are no such issues and the site isn't shoving an app down your throat every 2 seconds. Super annoying and almost enough to make me want to quit the platform. Ill change my rating when NOT using the app stops ruining the experience, until then PC only.",2020-12-02 19:41:10,1
"The user interface is routinely glitchy. This app is my primary interface for Reddit. The content algorithm being repetitive aside, just simple tapping on different posts often doesn't work. It stays like that for a while and then opens the post you first tapped on after you scroll on ahead to different posts. The search feature is the only decently functional feature that I appreciate.",2023-06-14 16:10:31,1
"New video player has made me uninstall this app. Wouldn't be so far if you could choose the older video format, but forcing this hot garbage was too much. The player is unintuitive, and makes comments unnecessarily difficult to navigate. Often I just want to read the comments of a post after watching a video - this update leaves no option but to take up at least half the screen with the video still. Awful update, won't be back until it's removed.",2021-07-15 22:14:52,1
"Basically doesn't work. Videos won't play, messages don't load, the app frequently crashes or refuses to open. Reddit's video player is so bad that I could only use reddit gifs externally.

Have to use the clear all button from the search bar. Please fix it.",2023-07-20 19:41:58,1
"I hate the constant updates, especially when they break perfectly functional features. I can't even use the search function properly anymore. If I use a SwiftKey keyboard, I can't type in numbers, and if I use a default Samsung keyboard, then the backspace doesn't work. Also I still get sent to random pages when I tap links in the home screen occasionally.",2018-09-22 07:58:57,1
"The UI is small and need larger touch targets. Eg getting to a user profile when it is extremely near to the subreddit name is often times difficult to access. Or trying to access the eclipse menu to get to other options. App performance is also very slow and clunky. Navigating pages is slow to the point where I feel like I didn't perform the navigation action until the app thrn moves. The app also too easily loses your place on a previous page, causing too much scrolling to find where you were.",2023-08-11 06:29:21,1
"The Reddit mobile app is a complete disappointment. The user interface is beyond unintuitive. Navigating through different sections and subreddits is an absolute headache.

It's frustrating to constantly struggle with the app's counterintuitive design choices.",2023-07-01 00:44:55,1
"This recent update broke file downloads. When I download a picture, it downloads with the filename, ending with jpg, but not .jpg, meaning that it does not display properly, and in fact, if I attempt to embed a picture by say, sharing on Discord, the file will just show as an unreadable file, not a picture; and this is not a problem with Discord, I tested other pictures I downloaded elsewhere and they displayed without issue. If this bug can be fixed soon, that would be greatly appreciated.",2021-05-15 16:08:19,1
"Gave it a shot, but found it utterly unfriendly to use - particularly given the buggy interface, obscene amount of advertising, and the lack of a decent condensed, compact view when browsing.

It runs Assoluto Racing with no issue. It keeps freezing regularly.

I really don't like it going full screen just by tapping as there's no way to easily just check how long a video is, and the swiping thing is just annoying.

Edit: also it is so incredibly slow I cannot believe anybody actually uses it. Reddit can either bring back the apps or fix this hot garbage but until then I'm gone",2023-07-01 17:48:05,1
"New video player interface is really terrible. Is it trying to be TikTok or something? I want to pause and rewind a video but as soon as I try the video goes full screen?? And impossible to see comments without going through the fullscreen interface, and even then the comments are sort of in a popup? Old interface for videos was just fine, it worked, it was intuitive, and it didn't get in the way. Guess I'm downloading an older version 😕",2022-02-12 05:56:22,2
"I can lose myself in so many questions, and different themes and I love reading different answers and opinions. Love it.",2024-02-11 08:28:32,5
"The new media player has completely ruined the app. When you go to open a reply to a comment it automatically opens the video over everything, and the comments are inaccessible. Not to mention it has taken away quality of life aspects like being able to see how long a video is, or even just pause it, without opening the video first, which is a painfully slow process in and of itself.",2022-02-06 01:25:42,1
"Love being able to find people of like minds, great place to see and share content!",2024-03-16 00:30:22,5
"Have been forced to change to this after using RIF for almost 10 years. The errors and bugs are constant. It can't be customised like RIF could, the interface is cluttered and ugly, and overall there's too much focus on pointless bells and whistles rather than getting the core browsing experience right. This an extremely poor experience and a huge downgrade from the seamless browsing offered by RIF. I am using Reddit much less now, and if this frustration continues I'll likely leave altogether.",2023-07-04 22:40:09,1
"Finally buckled and installed the app after Reddit was scum and went after third-party apps, I was tired of mobile-browser Reddit. This app is like 2% better than the mobile browser site, which they make harder to use in an effort to get you to download this garbage anyways.",2023-11-14 00:56:16,1
"Awful UI as well as just being a clunky and slow piece of software. When I can open Reddit in a mobile browser and it runs smoother than your app, and actually loads my subs, you have major design flaws in your app. Multiple third party apps solved these problems, I guess Reddit didn't learn from them. Maybe in a few years this app will reach and or surpass the old third party apps, maybe.",2023-07-13 00:54:20,1

"I love Reddit, but the app is abysmal. The app contains so many bugs it is almost unusable.",2024-02-14 19:51:19,1
I use this app to help me look into facts vs opinions. Very useful!,2024-04-17 17:30:17,5
"It's very slow and buggy. Clicking on posts take them ages to open. Then comments load after a minute. Sometimes in frustration when I click on the posts multiple times, it will open it multiple times as well. The videos don't work half the time, sound is the same. Wrong posts load up sometime. If I list out all the bugs in this app, I would probably waste half an hour writing it knowing that the devs are never gonna fix this. This app just keeps on getting worse and worse. No other options av",2023-07-25 14:18:34,1
"I love reddit, it's a funny asf and I love the NSFW (obviously) I spend alot of tune on this app just scrolling for hours laughing at memes, I totally recommend this app, it's amazing",2024-04-11 05:06:26,5
"Crashes often, looses where it is in your feed, video audio often gets stuck when you swipe away. It's a mess.",2024-01-03 08:28:18,1

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I CAN'T CHANGE MY PROFILE PICTURE. I'M STUCK USING THE DEFAULT IMAGE. FIX THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2024-03-28 13:15:41,1
"I hate this app. Pity I can't use Boost anymore, just makes me want to stop using the website altogether. Entering posts and backing out to the feed results in it going to the top of the feed 90% of the time, losing my progress and making me scroll all the way back down. Text posts won't even let me swipe through to the next one, so actually looking at a post gives me no option but to miss the post or go back to the top.",2023-08-07 00:15:03,2
Dear sir/madam I am facing some bugs that do not show my post upvotes and coments I get a notification as 50upvotes but when I open the app it shows around 2 .people are not able to comment to my post please fix this problem in your coming updates Thankyou,2024-02-26 17:05:45,5
Worse app ever when I opened it then I started chatting there and all of a sudden can't send message anymore,2024-03-12 15:01:23,1

You want the worst? Well this is second best in that. Reddit a very family-friendly app 10/10 would reccomend.,2024-04-07 01:43:51,5
"Well you guys have really broken the app this time, I can't even reply to a comment without it crashing! Do you actually have a QA function? If you do, how on earth do they manage to do such a consistently poor job of finding obvious bugs? Or perhaps you just aren't fixing what's reported? It's like Windows ME all over again.",2023-12-05 07:39:07,1
Love all the different things to see and to explore,2024-04-19 12:49:20,4
This app is complete garbage. There are ads everywhere. You get ads in your mailbox. They push to turn on notifications constantly. It's aggroware. I'm sure they're data mining and selling everything they can. Reddit execs are scum. You heard me u/spez. Stay away. Stay away.,2023-11-17 15:30:12,1
Not able to link my social media with this app it says add links but it's saying not able to add my links please fix this problem,2024-02-12 19:30:46,3
"New UI is garbage, videos that had controls conveniently placed in the center space of the screen have been pushed to tiny icons in the very bottom corner of your screen. No more swipe movements to navigate to comments? Who thought this would be a good idea? I don't give a **** about the awards or upvotes on the post, let me watch and control the video. Move the useless buttons away. Stop copying TikTok, their UI is equally garbage.",2022-02-02 17:53:52,1
"Constant slowdowns(loading data error), it's horrible.",2024-03-07 19:17:08,1
"Terrible terrible app. Awfully optimised, runs very badly. When you press the back button on a post it will bring you back to the top of the page, meaning you either have to scroll back down or just give up trying to use the app. Even opening posts doesn't work, sometimes it will show a completely different post to the one you tried to open. And a stupid amount of ads now.",2023-04-30 08:40:06,1
"The UI, speed, and responsiveness of the reddit app sucks compared to third party apps that previously existed. My reddit consumption has gone down significantly since being forced to use the official reddit app. It's also funny seeing ads from major brands sitting next to NSFW content. What's brand safety?",2023-11-17 12:46:35,1
"The app is terrible, it won't let me block any groups and continually brings them up again and again. It just tells me something went wrong and then brings them back up again five minutes later.",2023-12-29 16:51:52,1
"The app is pretty unstable. Mute settings aren't kept when you exit a post to go back to the feed. Sometimes a post is loaded twice, therefore I have to click on the back button twice, as exiting a first time bring me back to the same post. Right now, the app does not load a post when I click on it from my feed. It just loads a white screen. When going back, my feed is reloaded and I lose the post I wanted to see. My history isn't updated either, meaning I have to manually search that post.",2023-10-17 23:06:11,1
"It was already bad before. Pictures, videos or certain subreddit sometimes won't load. And now? With recent update, everything refuses to load. It's a mess.",2023-11-19 13:12:55,1
Very good program like a forum. It's amazing!,2024-04-17 19:01:12,5
Text in phone app too small. It's there any way that the text size could be made bigger? Text in every other app on my phone is comfortable to read but the reddit app is too small. Could this be attended so we can increase size? Bring back Baconreader 😭,2024-01-25 05:20:30,1
I love the app on how everyone answers your questions quickly and they are always reliable.,2024-03-23 03:25:52,5
Not the most user friendly or accessible friendly. Basic things like changing the font size do not even exist.,2024-01-26 20:23:52,1
I've been a redditor for many years and this is the best way to access the site for posting and responding.,2024-04-19 05:14:16,5
"Dreadful app, completely unusable. Autoplay has been broken for years and still loads videos even when disabled. Absolutely eats through data (used it for an hour and it used over 100MB - for comparison, used boost for a MONTH and it only used 500MB). The cache also becomes unimaginably large, probably due to all the excess data it's downloading. The 'Home' algorithm is abysmal, forcing you to create multireddits (limited to 100 commuities) in order to get feed sorting options. Just AVOID!",2023-07-07 10:28:25,1
"I love reddit, but the reddit APP is very poorly made. Videos glitching, comments not appearing, freezing, can't comment, bugs everywhere. It's horrible. They removed third party tools which benefit us and now we are left with an app programmed by high schoolers... This is not a good product. They need to improve. My videos have been freezing and mysteriously not loading occasionally for over a year now. Few QOL improvements were implemented in a WHILE. They need to fix this. Use old.reddit.",2023-07-14 17:55:17,2
Why is everything broken on this app. Top comment is always buggy and gets hidden behind the ads. Why can't I use 3rd party?,2024-03-18 19:55:34,1
Can't log in. Details are correct. App is terrible.,2024-04-19 08:39:55,1
I enjoy your app. In a crazy world you provide a bit of fun and entertainment. You can find just about every niche here.,2024-03-15 21:25:02,5
An Ad every 2 post. Way to ruin Reddit. This app gets worse with every update. Absolute trash.,2024-02-23 07:18:23,1
Only rated a 3 for now as I haven't used the app unless it's popped up on a Google search. I'll update my review and stars when I've used it properly,2024-03-05 00:25:24,3
"Hello, the app is great, I'm just having an issue in uploading pictures . wherever I upload a photo it fails, whether in the comments or in posts. Besides that, the platform is amazing",2023-12-31 21:27:28,4
"When opening a weblink you get redirected to the app, but when you press back, you go to your homepage, which can be NSFW. Thanks, idiots, great way to retain interactions.",2024-01-20 14:49:15,1
This app is not good. Like at all. The video player is completely broken and doesn't play sound for many videos. Other apps can play these videos with sound without a problem. The UI is just made to serve the content reddit wants you to see with minimal sorting options. This app was once ok to use but updates and corporate greed have ruined it.,2023-07-05 19:29:58,1
"Excellent online forum website. IF reddit can keep its APIs open, and at reasonable cost, to serious independent, student, and small coders, Reddit should still be around another 20 years",2024-02-23 17:10:29,4
The bugs on Android makes it feel sluggish to use. There are message errors when trying to send a chat message. I hope it can be resolved,2024-01-30 12:20:47,4

"The unofficial apps reddit killed were much better than this app. Everything is slow, videos are laggy, layout looks bad. All of that is without considering how bad and bot-ridden reddit is as a platform now.",2024-02-07 19:56:57,1
"The new update takes a difficult app and makes it much less usable... Again! When a post is cross posted, if I try to click on the original post it just opens the link the post is discussing. There's no way to go to the actual original post and see the comments there. The video player is a massive faff, trying to click play and unmute and open it in a not-annoying way. And then when done there isn't much space to read comments, even when you slide it away. Rubbish. Unusable.",2022-02-19 14:23:43,1
It gives you true answers that are not allowed on other apps you can always always get your answer to Shady weird obscure or harsh truths on Reddit and I love it because you can't ask these kind of questions to normal on normal web pages or whatever you call them,2024-03-26 10:11:39,5
"Every update it just gets worse.... There's an old saying, ""if it isn't broke, don't fix it"". I wish more developers knew about it.",2024-02-28 15:53:26,1
Always something interesting and unusual to view.,2024-04-04 16:46:02,5
"They literally screwed up the mobile app, the constant loading errors whenever in Wi-Fi, unplayable videos, blank images, upvotes that doesn't register. More and more.",2024-01-24 17:46:28,1
"I like this app and spend a lot of time on it, though it's current state is bad. There's this bug when sometimes you just can't view a certain thing, for example sometimes it just won't let you open any subreddit, sometimes it will just not let you look through anyone's profile, and sometimes it'll just not let you look stuff up. It is incredibly annoying, and happens way too often. This is just one of the multiple bugs but it's the one I deal with the most and is the most annoying.",2022-03-10 21:44:29,3
great minds and great personalities starts here. it is an excellent app!,2024-04-18 21:27:08,5

"Absolutely horrid UX. Opening a post can have a good 30-45 second delay. Loading posts after e.g. switching the ordering can take even longer, up to 2 minutes. Video player is borderline unusable. Many buttons are unresponsive, e.g. deleting a subreddit from the search history. Opening links in an external browser used to work, but doesn't anymore. This is shameful software engineering in the 21st century.",2023-07-31 18:30:20,1
"Since I am now forced to use the official reddit app,I will be honest. It improved. But in terms of accessibility, it's still nowhere near some of the old third party options. If accessibility for certain conditions, especially visual impairment, is important to you, you should stick to the desktop website experience. Same goes for mod options. My old review was removed by Google, so this is an updated version.",2023-11-08 10:43:08,1
"I like the Reddit app. It wasn't getting the best reviews, in comparison to the third-party apps. But it does what its supposed to do. People make Reddit a melting pot of ideas, creativity, arguments, absurdities, humor, advice, and more. There literally is something for everyone.",2024-01-26 06:42:12,5
"This app continues to get worse and worse. Half the time videos don't load, the other half of the time the comments don't load. I don't know what happened to you Reddit, but shame on you for following Digg and ruining a platform. I hope your IPO fails and you all get nothing for your years of neglect.",2024-03-17 00:25:09,1
Update by update we got from annoying to simply unusable.,2024-04-22 20:45:53,1

Edit: version 2024.08.0... scrolling is just awful....!",2024-02-23 23:59:06,1
"Edit on 5/12/23. Every update is a bigger mess than before. Congratulations, you have managed to make this the most unusable app to ever exist. Absolutely pathetic app. If you killed 3rd party apps, atleast make yours usable. Lags all the time constantly, makes your phone lag as well.",2023-12-05 04:47:01,1
"Terrible experience, gave it a shot after the API change. Horribly cluttered feed without the ability to customise. Aside from Constant adds and 'suggested' posts, biggest issue is custom feeds don't scroll to the next from the feed from inside the posts, they just throw up some miscalaneous post from a sub not in the custom feed. The experience is extremely dishartening from a 10+ year user. My Reddit time is down and am likely to abandon the platform altogether as a result of the API change.",2023-07-20 12:43:18,1
"The worst modern social media app I've ever used. All its competition is somehow better. I've experienced issues of every kind. Images failing to upload, with no solution. Redownloading app, resizing images, compressing image size, clearing app cache and data, absolutely nothing works. I've never experienced such a core issue in a social media app until reddit. Even if you search for solutions you'll find nobody has a working one since the issue has existed for years and will stay that way. 1/5",2023-09-26 15:21:55,1
Ruined third party apps. You'd think after 7 years of me saying no I don't want notifications they'd stop having pop ups trying to get me to turn them on every time I open the app and every third reddit page I visit,2024-01-25 11:14:41,1

"Unreliable and bloated despite lacking features. For reasons known only to themselves, Reddit seem to have built their own video player in rather than using Android's own one. The result is constant bugs, inconsistent volume. The layout wastes precious screen space, and the default precaching behaviour rinses data. Maybe they should have learnt from competing apps rather than simply killing their API.",2023-07-01 21:21:26,1
"It really surprises me how terrible this is, and that feeling is only compounded by being forced to use it to read pretty much anything online on mobile. Slow, unintuitive, extremely glitchy (constantly experiencing unreadable notifications). I understand reddit's need to be profitable to remain sustainable, but surely if you are going to try to approach it the way they have, surely you need to make your first-party app at least remotely on par the alternatives.",2023-08-29 07:40:59,1
"Smooth operation. Does what I need it to. Small hiccups with individual notification, though. selection will load the main feed instead of individual thread. So I have to dig for original notification :\",2023-12-02 20:51:33,5
"Great app and social network. Sure there's toxic behavior in some subreddits, humans can suck. The subreddits for my interests are all great and people are generally nice and supportive in interactions. It can also be a great place to find support ie queer community, medical, mental health, troubleshooting, nerdy stuff.",2024-01-05 20:47:07,5
"This is the only all that has trouble loading videos in every way possible. Sometimes other video sounds play, sometimes the video doesn't play at all, and sometimes it disappears. I recently found out third-party apps fixed this, but that the douchy-sounding Reddit team is putting an insane price cap on them. How about you fix your god damn app before that???",2023-06-10 01:50:27,1
It's a decent app. I still prefer the desktop version. Chats were out of order. Happens occasionally but once I figured it out I can deal with it.,2023-11-14 12:38:33,4

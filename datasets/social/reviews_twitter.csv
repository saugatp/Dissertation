"Every few hours, the app decides to not load at all for several minutes. This means you can't refresh your feed, you can't view your messages, and you can't even view your notifications until it sorts itself out. This has not been fixed and no, this is not an internet issue as this happens regardless of wifi and data. Completely broken app.",2024-04-25 09:50:39,1
"Since I can't go any lower than one star, this is all I can do for this app. Been on Twitter (X) for 15 years and this is the worst it's been. I constantly have trouble with the app loading and freezing, I am unable to refresh my messages and my feed, and the spaces either freeze up or you can't hear the audio at all. Also, when you block something, you can still see it elsewhere.. A LOT has changed for the negative and we need to go back to what was working.",2024-04-18 13:19:40,1
"It's nice when it works, but overall, it's been a downward spiral since Musk's takeover. Randomly, it'll stop loading content and won't refresh (sometimes fixed by clearing cache most of the time that wont work), and there's a weird bug where it'll stop loading/refreshing when charging my phone. It's so annoying, and the bots are taking over.",2024-04-17 22:17:43,2
"The last few years have been a downside in quality, but this is the worst it's been. DMs always freezing or crashing, completely nonsense ads, AI and bots all over the place, the constant ""please try again later"" error message for basic tasks that used to function completely fine, and a bunch of added features like video calling that no frequent twitter user would want. Not to mention it's the only app I use that makes my phone overheat, even when I drop the brightness. An absolute shame.",2024-04-23 06:05:48,1
"Randomly stops loading tweets and pretty much the whole app as if I have no Internet. But my Internet isn't the problem, as I am easily able to load the website on my phone's Google Chrome browser with no connection issues. It's the app itself and this has been a problem for a while, since it became ""X"". Fix your app, please. Thank you.",2024-04-11 02:23:45,1
"The latency on this app is getting progressively worse. Nothing in the app loads like 75% of the time. At this point, every time it crashes, I just go to threads. This all started when X Engineering announced it was removing its cloud subscriptions. Seems like their private infrastructure can't keep up: ""Optimized our usage of cloud service providers and began doing much more on-prem. This shift has reduced our monthly cloud costs by 60%. Among the changes we made was a shift of all media/blob""",2024-04-07 16:05:47,1
"Everything is fine for the most part. However, starting about a month ago I have been completely unable to send more than one photo per tweet; the tweet will instantly fail to send. And there's no way to reach your support team, as I've tried, and it just sends me into a loop of ""help articles"". As an artist who uses this app, being unable to send multiple images is extremely detrimental to me. Please fix this.",2024-03-01 14:22:39,1
"I've used Twitter for almost two years now, exclusively through browsers, both desktop and mobile, with minimal problems. I downloaded this app because it has functions unavailable on the browser site, such as audio-visual stuff, tweeting videos and sound clips. The app doesn't work, will not allow me to sign in. I tried using my e-mail instead of my username, and it still didn't work. I deliberately entered a wrong password; it identified it as incorrect. The app is broken, not Twitter itself.",2024-03-20 00:18:35,1
"When I attempt to send a reply with photos, I often get a ""Failed to send post"" notification. This has been occuring for around a month. I have to keep a tab with X open in Google Chrome just to post photos! Also, the search bar in the search section has been hit or miss recently with results not always showing. In addition, I cannot long-press and copy or delete DMs if they contain text and a link. This has been a problem since October 2022.",2024-03-13 02:51:31,1
"one star is the lowest I can go. this app is trying way to hard to be something it isn't. so focused on looking nice that a lot of its functions are just gone. notifications are permanently gone. when uploading photos, always met with ( Failed to send post ). to top it off, it always crashes after a certain amount of time. find something better to use, genuinely. do NOT get this app. 💀",2024-03-22 20:04:59,1
"Everything app...well it's getting there. Video content and quality are great. First for information and news. I check X before checking anything else. Much better than when it was Twitter. Developer suggestions to allow premium members to listen to the content while the lock screen is on, kind of like a headphone mode or something. My earbuds can't pause content. That would be a nice addition. Other than that, this is a great app.",2024-03-10 20:05:23,5
"Update: 04/02/2024 still have to force close this app multiple times a day and clear the cache just to see pictures and most of the timeline... Please fix this. I'm on a new Pixel 8 pro.... I'm annoyed and tired of having to clear all of this constantly throughout the day. Still works on Web browser but this app is garbage!! It freezes multiple times during the day, sometimes up to an hour at a time!! Ridiculous!",2024-04-02 07:33:37,1
"For the last couple of months, X has been a real nightmare. It stops working randomly during the day and doesn't load anything. It's not an Internet problem, it's an app problem. This same issue never happens on the browser, which I have to switch to whenever the app stops working. This is absurd and the worst thing about it is that people at X either don't know about this issue or just don't care...",2024-02-28 23:39:40,1
"The app was great for connecting, networking, and getting updates from creators I was a fan of. Now, however, it refuses to load any images, pages, or messages half the day, and now flat out refuses to let me sign in. Its been chalk full of bots, bugs and corrupt and sadistic people that have been platformed, protected, and amplified since it changed hands, but hey it was atleast USABLE before. I only give it 2 stars because I still have connections there and hope it can come back in some way.",2024-03-20 04:36:49,2
Something changed. Everything is HUGE now. Fonts and spacing are way better in my browser. Tested across two phones ( Pixel 4a 5G ) and I have the same issue on both. All other apps on both phones are fine and nothing else except updating X is different. I did not have this issue with the older version of X. Extremely disappointed. I will now have to use the browser and not the app.,2024-04-09 21:04:36,1
"The app reset itself to auto update without my permission - I've been avoiding updating to 'x' for a number of reasons. The ads are unbearable, showing up every 2 or 3 tweets including in replies and in qrts, the bots are out of control w/ 1 of every 25 messages, follows or replies being from bots. Verified user content is pushed 1st in every aspect. The ""for you"" being the default homepage is obnoxious, recommended tweets are impossible to avoid. Everything about this app sucks, now especially.",2024-04-09 21:21:12,1
"Awful, awful... too many issues to really care about. the basic version worked just fine, so I figured if I paid for the X premium, it would only be that much better...Wrong!! Now that I try to cancel the monthly subscription, it's like pulling teeth!! The Support message board doesn't even work, I keep getting a ""Retry something went wrong"" message! Quick and easy to take my money, but virtually impossible to cancel. My name should appear on the side of the Space X rocket😠",2024-03-20 09:05:08,1
"What a seriously screwed up app. I've never used X or Twitter. Downloaded the App for the first time and was immediately informed that my account was locked/suspended. Went through all the verification steps and still the account is locked. A message to X Support went unanswered and there does not appear to be a way to contact them. Still to this day, I've never used this platform so I have no idea what the platform is about, and no way to start using it. Wish I could rate it Zero stars...",2024-03-15 10:48:46,1
"Ever since Elon took over, this app has gone downhill and it's getting worse. I keep getting notifications that I've got new messages but when I go to my messages inbox, this notification pops up: ""cannot retrieve messages at this time."" This happens almost daily! Updated the app about 10 minutes ago and it has crashed 10 times since then",2024-03-28 21:30:57,1
Constantly getting kicked out of dms. Type a few words and kicks me back to notification page. A box pops up telling me there's a bug in the app and to put app in deep sleep mode. I have ran multiple updates and removed and reinstalled app multiple times. The problem continues. UPDATE: Now pics won't send in dms. Just saying preparing to upload. Wth....so I canceled my premium plan.,2024-03-18 18:05:03,1
"Every week or two I need to reinstall this app because it starts freezing and crashing constantly for no discernable reason while using it. I've tried updating, constantly clearing the cache for it, nothing works except reinstalling it. I've been dealing with this since the rebranding and it is so goddamn frustrating. At least before that, my complaints were about poor management or removal of certain features rather than the app literally ceasing function.",2024-03-16 15:45:58,2
"After the recent update I am unable to see the spaces on top of the screen, the space button bring only 3 to 4 spaces not all the choice like before and you charge me for the blue tik. I might have to think when comes the renewal time for the subscription. All the updates recently had something disappearing. Sad thing is that using the premium now you want more money for the premium plus. If what I am paying for in not working right, what make you think I am gonna pay more for more suckyfeatures",2024-03-10 22:32:54,2
"This app does not work as well as it used to. It suddenly refreshes at inopportune times (making the tweet you are reading disappear), it crashes too often, and the algorithm prioritzes showing conspiracy theories and bigotry. There is still some good on Twitter, but under the current management it is harder than ever before to find it.",2024-03-11 05:42:04,1
"I have used Twitter / X for a decade now, and through all the changes of the app I've never had an issue like this that made the app unusable. I open the app and it brings up whatever I left it on, but it will not load new tweets, or let me see replies/media of the ones already loaded. It's not my internet because every other app works. A random series of actions such as closing the app is the only thing that works, but sometimes not for hours. I use the app for business so please fix this.",2024-03-26 00:53:54,1
"Rarely works anymore... the past year, it's been getting more and more sporadic... it's hours at a time that the APP won't even open, or I'll get notifications, but I can't view them - get an error that ""can't retrieve messages, try again later"" - extremely frustrating, and although I will miss my community, it appears to be time to find an alternative.",2024-02-23 01:42:22,2
"The content and function of the app and social media platform is satisfactory and enjoyable. My poor review of this app isn't due to the X(Twitter or whatever)platform itself , but the app. The app crashes often well typing messages to friends, any message longer than a short sentences risks taking long enough that the app crashes and I loose what I was typing. I've cleared the cache and data and reinstalled the app, still the same. Once this is fixed the app will be 5 stars.",2024-03-14 05:20:56,2
"Video player working is hit or miss, and it is not uncommon for the app to fail to load my feed. Broken. **update** Also important to note that trying to view your feed while charging your phone completely breaks the app with no content being able to load. **Update** 3/13/24: App is still unable to function while phone is charging. Also feed may ""bottom out"" and show no new content; some sort of refresh issue. Restarting the app solves it though.",2024-03-13 17:10:34,1
"The app has is terrible. Functionality has gone way down. App crashes after a certain amount of time. Crashes if I try and send a tweet to multiple people. Videos/pictures take a long time to load, if at all. The only thing that keeps me around is that the other users are funny. The app itself is terrible.",2024-04-03 23:14:01,1
"I'm having a problem watching older videos. It happens sometimes to all videos but the older they get, the more they glitch, skip around, and freeze, to the point where videos from a year ago and older are almost all unwatchable. The translate button often doesn't work. The app just stops functioning for random periods of time every day. Nothing loads and I can't tweet anything. No, clearing cache doesn't do anything. So broken. A legit 1 star experience",2024-01-29 12:06:40,1
"If you want to pivot to streaming, please have a functional video player first. The video player should not fill the whole screen at the cost of cutting off the top and bottom of the content. At least let the user decide. Also, it is way too easy to close the video when just trying to navigate. It frequently just decides that the video doesn't want to resume play and so I have to close and restart it. Just an all around terrible experience 👍",2023-11-18 19:18:52,1
"""For the past couple months, this app has hardly worked. Loading in at any given time will show a black screen with the loading circle, but nothing loads. Either that or it will show the last tweets you looked at and not refresh them or allow you to go into the replies. You can't search or anything else, it will just be frozen on each tab. Refreshing the app does not help and it doesn't load sometimes until 10-30 minutes later. This happens multiple times a day as well."" Agree emphatically!!",2023-12-31 19:34:18,1
"I love the app but I've noticed recently whenever I enter a space to listen, that when I close out, it remains at the bottom of my screen and I can't go to another space. and if you hit the ""leave"" again to try and close it, it doesn't really close. I've had to uninstall and reinstall 6 or 7 times when that happens. other than that, this is where I get my news now and I really like Community notes!",2024-01-05 14:14:36,4
"I have to say that before the transition into X this app worked perfectly and of course, there were many bugs but they actively fixed them. Now every update there are problems after problems of things that hinder my experience here. First off when I got to look at my old tweets it never gave me a problem before but recently I haven't been able to see them. Maybe a few recent ones but I have over 3k tweets I can't see anymore but it shows up for everyone else",2023-12-04 07:55:55,1
"Ever since that scrub took over, the app randomly decides it just doesn't work. Nothing loads. It just sits with a blank screen.

It's truly a bad experience. I wish I could give this app an even lower score. It's been consistently bad, and worse than the iOS app. Feels like non-premium accounts are being throttled.

One more thing, I thought that was happening with my account because it might not be an updated version. That's why I un-installed the app and then installed it again. And now my account is not logging In. Kindly fix it ASAP.",2024-04-18 20:42:29,1

I enjoy X. It's definitely a much roudier place since Elon Musk took it over but that also made it more fun. I feel like most other social media platforms are extremely sterile. They don't offer the same level of exchange I can get from X. Reddit is basically a hybrid of Digg and Tumblr and competitors like Threads just aren't providing the same features. The application itself is still the best user experience I've had in terms of layout and function. They perfected it.,2024-04-24 18:17:55,5

And it doesn't offer up much to allow u to just click back to what u were viewing. U have to navigate back to the account and then to the post. Many other apps stay on the previous screen when I return, but on X it's frustrating so it limits my use of the site.

Dare I say this but it was better when it was still Twitter!! Yes it had its problems yet it didn't glitch as much as it does now 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ this is bs 😒",2024-04-24 18:41:59,1
I love X. The community notes feature is fantastic in shutting down misinformation. Seeing unfiltered news across the world in real time is eye-opening. Spaces are another favourite feature. Being able to debate and discuss topics I'm interested in or listen to specialists in the field discussing. Plus they are the only social media platform that seem to do anything about removing content that breaks the rules. I never have any luck with Meta or Tiktok.,2024-04-24 22:00:04,5
"Within the past few months it's gotten harder and harder to use. Most of the time my feed won't even load. Hard resetting the app, or my device doesn't even fix it so I don't think it could be my fault at this point. I'm not even sure why I keep using it even after everything that's happened.",2024-04-25 02:45:59,1
There are profiles that I don't follow or don't follow back appearing on my verified followers. I've been following them and unfollowing them but they seem to be still there. I even tried blocking and unblocking them but they are still there. I can't get in contact with support because they don't have an email to begin with so I can't even talk to support.,2024-04-24 00:17:56,1
Love this app. I was not interested in this app until Elon Musk bought twitter and changed it to X. I have loved it and made new connections and friends and feel better informed than ever before. I no longer read newspaper's or watch news channels. Why? Why read about yesterdays news with skewed bias and opinions when I can see today's news now Live and make up my own mind on things. Many Thanks Iain.,2024-04-24 18:07:36,5
I had really hoped that this last update would fix the problem of the app freezing and deleting DMs but it didn't. It didn't do anything. Nobody even writes what the updates do anymore but I know this one didn't fix this issue because I just had it happen to me FOUR TIMES trying to write twelve words in a DM. If I could give negative stars I would. All these five star reviews are liars or paid,2024-04-24 10:34:26,1
Lots of improvements since Elon took over. Too expensive for many though. Free version is very limited and may turn off users due to the limited functions. Otherwise it's among the best in regards to upholding Freedom of Speech. In these days that's quite important.,2024-04-25 11:58:50,3
"DMs just crash constantly for no reason, and it makes it particularly annoying when I'm trying to type a message I'm almost finished with, and then it just crashes and closes the app out of nowhere, meaning I have to type it all over again. It'll even just crash when scrolling through them casually. It's been like this for months now.",2024-04-20 19:30:10,3
This app is an okay for me but the reason why I rate it 1 star is because of the auto scroll feature like what's the purpose of this app if you can't just aimlessly scroll to your hearts content and there isn't even a way to disable it you just have to be lucky enough for it not to occur I tried searching for a way to disable it but none of them worked,2024-04-25 12:17:12,1

"the app stops loading anything for around half an hour at a time at least, to the point where it is barely usable. The timeline will randomly refresh WHILE I'm scrolling, causing posts I barely saw for a second to disappear to never be seen again. Bots are rampant to the point it is now a meme. I want to continue using this app but it seems the app itself is against me",2024-04-06 16:11:51,1
I have never been closer to uninstalling this app and just being done with it. That's how infuriating it's been lately. It takes forever to load when you've been away from the app from anywhere above an hour and this happens no matter how strong your network might be. I'm talking as much as 7 - 10 minutes wait time. It's ridiculous.,2024-03-21 15:09:54,2

I'm really trying to use this app. But it only replays the same videos over and over for days and weeks. Why am I seeing the same videos over and over everyday. I guess X doesn't have much access to other videos. Very hard to understand and navigate. I'm losing interest. Not happy about it either. I was really hoping X would be better than Tik Tok or Instagram. I get more frustrated with X. X gets boring after a little while. Oh well I guess X isn't trying to be the best.,2024-04-08 13:38:41,1

Anyway, this app has talented artists, people with good messages, funny memes, etc. Unfortunately it also comes with the downside of sick people being toxic to everyone else, although that's also a by-product of humanity's failures.

It's a wonderful social media app. I share a lot of wonderful uplifting videos instead of the world events. I have permission to share these clips from the original people. Everybody loves them and my messages I add. However I do get hit with a lot of copyright infringement cases. Twitter/X has been amazing at working with me to get these straightened out with the copyright companies. Most have been fraudulent claims and I thank X dearly for not suspending my account. Love this app! ❤️,2024-04-05 10:07:14,5
"It remains a useful and relevant platform to me for news, information, political advocacy, but increasingly folks are leaving to other platforms so I'm missing out on a lot, advertisements are of useless products and services, bots are a much bigger problem than before, and something has changed in the algorithm and/or the average user, so much more often finding right wing jerks in my mentions harassing me or just saying ridiculous things. So the user experience for me has decreased by a lot.",2024-03-28 12:06:51,3

I downloaded this app because some news/articles link to it and so I wanted to be able to read full stories. However receiving push notifications for every thing Elon Musk tweets [when I don't care to follow him] is annoying. I even get push notifications whenever his Mother tweets [barf] I get it it's his app but you don't need the marketing Elon?

X is my go-to app for latest news and talks. It has gotten significantly better but I keep getting unpersonalized tweets from unknown accounts. It is a great place to know about latest events and happenings around the world & the app is not boring or irrelevant compared to other apps.

"While a less ""fluffy/flowery"" Twitter compared to ""Pre-Elon"" X is actually allowing tough conversations to be had AND allowing a lot of the other aspects to grow more organically again. Some algorithm hiccups IMO, but it gets better each day/week from my experience. It's good to have views challenged and logic vetted publically. I find it helps strengthen bonds and clarify context that people could argue in circles about. Or else debate without an agreed upon context is just a shouting match. 🤔",2024-02-11 07:24:23,5

"This app has been pretty much unusable since the name change... For hours at a time the app will not load, so you're stuck seeing the same posts without being able to view any quotes or replies, you can't view your notifications or DMs, and you definitely can't search anything. It operates as if you have no Internet connection and closing or force stopping it does absolutely nothing. And unsurprisingly, my friends with iPhones have none of these issues.",2024-02-29 13:41:19,1
"I haven't experienced problems and glitches so far, but my rating is because X is FULL OF ADS, this makes the browsing experience really really annoying and non enjoyable. Twitter used to have some ads, but now it is full of them. If you see 10 posts, 4 of them are ads. Subscribing to premium is not an option for regular users, since we don't use much features, but an affordable option should be added to only remove those ANNOYING ADS. This app doesn't feel like a social network anymore.",2024-03-01 23:44:22,2

Updates all the time & I have never had so many functionality issues. Things mostly never load. Buffering on every post. Issues with the video players. Again, nothing loading. Your timeline barley loads. Far less community notes on posts (which promotes misinformation) ""townsquare of the internet""? Ha. BOTS AND ADS EVERY OTHER TWEET",2024-02-02 13:57:50,1
"Why can't I sign in 😮‍💨 when I enter my phone number it keeps on saying we cannot currently register this phone number. It's frustrating..if the app is not available for my country , please do something. I really need this app.I'm from Zimbabwe.",2024-04-15 12:18:42,1
On many occasions the app feed doesn't refresh no matter how many times you try or close/restart the app. This very frustrating. Sound effects don't work either which is also quite silly and has been an issue for several years across the various android phones I've had. 3 stars.,2024-02-27 21:37:02,3
"Have absolutely no issues with using X. App always works on every device, & now it will soon be on my TV, too! Most surprising find so far has been the quality of journalists readily available. Exceptional reporting that's usually far ahead of MSM & heads above MSM on accuracy. In fact, just realized I haven't watched MSM news in a while. Got tired of seeing rehashed of what I already knew.",2024-03-10 21:08:27,5
"Video watching is annoying. Speaker audio icon is too small, trying to press it annoyingly pops open the video. Either that or the icon is missing. Hitting back mutes it again.

Always bounce back or either say login error or login details incorrect. Good app though!!!",2024-03-08 09:33:35,4
The app works well for me. No issues and I've been on for years. I love that monetizing is now possible now too. Great improvements all around and they just keep rolling out. Basically I say try it out. It's free. You can get verified for a small monthly fee if you choose to. Make up your own mind if you like the app or not. Don't let others deter you.,2024-03-10 07:55:30,5
Trouble retrieving posts lately. For the last 4 or 5 days the App has been unable to retrieve a lot of data and posts from notifications of accounts I follow. I've cleared the cache and restarted my phone. Still trouble. What gives?,2024-03-25 13:54:35,3

"Better than ever, I think it's my most used app now. A great place to see in real time what people of all sorts are thinking and what's happening around the world. I hope it moves fast towards a platform for all kinds of media and content creators, and eventually an everythubg app. It has my full support.",2024-03-10 08:51:02,5
"I don't know what's going on with this app lately, but it's about a 50/50 shot that the content will actually load in. Every other time, there are just eternal loading screens and the ""Message Cannot Be Retrieved"" pop-up. Also I've never had an issue with bots and spam before, but now I can't go a day without some crypto scam tagging me in some scam. This app has become practically unusable these past few weeks.",2024-02-24 08:36:11,1

Thought I'm the only one facing the problem of the app being too slow and hanging. Takes too long to load up sometimes and uses most of your RAM while at it. Something needs to be fixed ...I'm looking for a better x app at the moment,2024-03-19 21:25:15,3

Since 2018 I was on and off using app and each times only spending less than 5 or 10 minutes the most. Nothing much got my attention. But year 2023 I started spending more time 2 to 4 hours on X as I found more posts I liked. Only a couple times in a few days I had some problems but that not a big deal At all. X platform is the best platform that I enjoyed using it a lot. Thank you for making things GREAT. 👍👍👍👍👍🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆,2024-03-10 22:05:24,5
"X isn't just a social platform; it's a marvel of technology. Its algorithms work like magic, serving up the most relevant tweets and trends tailored to my interests. The character limit might seem like a constraint, but it's actually a stroke of genius, encouraging concise and impactful communication. Plus, the seamless user interface makes navigating through tweets a breeze. Twitter truly sets the bar high when it comes to merging technology with social interaction",2024-03-14 12:42:38,5
"Best media app we have, but still so flawed. It has great functions and provides users who wish to upgrade their account get add-on features. However, unreliablity is the worst part, including the tweet limit and no function to search personal RTs. The 3.2k tweet view limit cap per account should be extended to at least 10k. Also needs a feed-history function since the feed refreshes too often on its own. Report system is horrid in too many ways. CS is all automated, but at least better than IG",2024-03-20 10:28:12,3
"Many issues, X doesn't deserve one star. Why do we have to pay to boost our posts? Wasn't the purpose of social media to reach out freely your message? I tried once to promote some rescued dogs by paying and that even didn't work. If you post in general you will get absolutely no exposure. I think TikTok it's a million times better than X and FB. FB is another platform that ofuscates your posts. The bad thing is that these guys have monopolysed the marked.",2024-03-10 14:06:18,1
"It's been years since I've used twitter, it was just surprising that the app was not functioning well and even editing your profile was failed everytime I tried to update my profile to keep my information accurate and actual. I don't even know what's going on with the app or is it just me that I should delete it. The app needs to be fixed, everyone is affected with this.",2024-02-25 07:23:31,1
"Since newest update 80% of the time the app doesn't work and refuses to load anything. Literally not asking for much, just for posts to actually load in and the ability to interact with them yet the most basic stuff doesn't work anymore. It's incredibly frustrating, this app has gone down the drain since being bought out to the point of not even working the most basic functions.",2024-01-30 18:00:51,1
Crashes when typing direct messages. Don't receive message notifications despite having notifications on. Would post this as a feedback instead of a review but it's been going on for too long for a company such as X. How is it so buggy!?,2024-03-27 07:59:02,1

This used to be one of my favorite apps and social media platforms that I've utilized for the past SIX years. That was until I got suspended for telling my best friend I would kill her as a joke in regards to a tweet she made. I was suspended within SECONDS of making the tweet and twitter refuses to give my account back. Their customer service is automated which is super frustrating because I want my account back. I've used that account for years it's really something near and dear to me.,2024-04-13 05:50:04,5

"Absolutely brilliant app, been using it since twitter. It's great for freedom of speech and alot less censored than other apps, its good for seeing information from both sides which gives you a rounded view to decide for your self unlike MSM.

It's a great app but the quote tweets is very disturbing. It only loads a few quoted tweets and stops not allowing one to explore or read all the quote tweets. This is very annoying especially if the topic is an Interesting one,2024-03-12 18:13:31,3

Mainly works quite well especially now that free speech is allowed. It's a great way to keep up on world and local events often disregarded and/or ignored by MSM. More options than the heart for acknowledging a tweet would be helpful and fun. Overall a great experience.,2024-02-23 21:54:32,5

"The changes that have occurred at Twitter, becoming X, are immensely positive. The X app provides access to the unfiltered truth of humanity. You cannot get this experience on any other platform. X is continuing its development and growth, and you are missing out if you are not in this sphere. Lastly, X has made legacy media irrelevant. Simply, all news is available on this platform, direct from the sources, BEFORE media editorial centers get their chance to distort reality. Stay with X!",2024-03-11 07:21:40,5

Open debate is critical to a functioning and free society, otherwise you get tyranny and oppression. X provides this open debate.

Twitter is pretty neat. Aslong as you don't spend a lot of time on it scrolling mindlessly. Get into niche communities and its really fun. All the bots in replies and the ragebait are the reason for one less star. I really like the platform besides that,2024-03-07 10:20:54,4

Can't even make an account. Has me verify I'm human but the thing I have to do doesn't even match at all. The left side says how many of one thing you find in the right side. But it only gives pictures to go through. And I have to do this 10 times. There has been one in the last 3 trys to just not match completely. You'd think they just let spam accounts show up to delete then later on. It's so hard to make an account anymore with any thing but this is by far the worst.,2024-01-22 18:09:33,1

Awesome site and value for data usage. Can find many topics and good videos and interesting things. Not slow and had no tech issues. Runs pretty smooth. The only disappointment I have is that I can't find a space where you can play games like Chess or Scrabble online. It would be great if X could add that feature.,2023-12-15 20:15:55,4

X Corp has improved this app tremendously! Everything from ad spamming to suggestions and even the search engine is more accurate. I'm actually seeing so much relative content now that I am some what overwhelmed. I can't possibly watch and read all of it. But what I do take to time to digest is totally worth it 9/10.

Once you pile up more on top, not only does it loose it's real identity but also what people already liked about it.

"The stupidest thing about this app bookmark feature. Delete bookmark is incredibly inconsistent as it sometimes shifts between the first spot and second spot (copy link option) and the worst fact is when you delete a bookmark it would just disappear from the fyp completely on mobile. My suggestion is to replace the view count on mobile with the bookmark icon (similar to desktop). Another visible problem is the slow loading speeds for both images/vids, which wasn't there before the acquisition.",2024-01-20 04:36:53,2

The site just pretty much decides to stop and start working whenever it feels like and for a social media app that is absolutely horrendous for a site to perform THAT bad.,2023-12-21 06:21:53,1
You'd think updates are supposed to fix bugs but apparently the developers at Twitter didn't get the memo because every new update is worse than the old one. The number of quote tweets users can see have been limited for some unknown reason. Videos don't play properly and you have to press the play button multiple times just to watch a video. Why focus on useless features no one asked for like peer-to-peer payments when you can't even get the app to work like it's supposed to,2024-01-12 06:18:23,1
"Coming from the iOS version of the app, there's some missing features and it feels less immersive. You can't add your profile to the nav bar, it doesn't take you to your post right away so you can see if you need punctuation or grammar correction after you post. You need to go to your post on your own. Other small things but still it could be worse",2024-01-20 09:57:43,4
"It has a lot of UI bugs on Android unfortunately. Like overlaying or weird behaviour of the UI, not remembering state of watching, pip broken or weird behaviour and listening to spaces heats up your phone...

I love this platform. It's free speech at its finest. Also it doesn't aggressively stalk me the way Meta's Facebook does even though I blocked tracking cookies and disabled its ability to monitor my location.,2024-03-10 09:08:03,5
I can't upload gifs or any media and most times I can't even see quotes. That man ruined this app,2024-04-22 19:02:02,1

I am using X since it was a Twitter but few days I have found a lot of development issues in this app one of the major issue is that when 2 video posts comes on the screen at a time X plays the Both videos even if I focused on one video by clicking then also in background another video plays continuously this irretates me of watching the focused video. Update the apl that only one video plays at a time even of it focused or not. Thanks Team X,2024-02-08 19:14:36,1

X is good but it can be better with few developments: 1) Enable users to edit their massages or tweets within 30 minutes after they have sent. 2) In some countries data prices is too high. Enable X app to have an option to hide images or blurry images until user choose whether to open it or not in order to reduce data usage. 3) Still on the data usage.

So far keeps getting better. I've had Twitter since it came out until they started kicking ppl off then I left. But I'm back like many and have used it 1000x more than I ever did before. Continue to notice drastic improvements on a weekly basis. Makes me disappointed I don't have stock of it anymore.,2024-01-26 12:58:34,5

"Ever since the name change and everything, I have no been able to log into my accounts or anything. No matter how many times I change the passwords and everything, its like my accounts have magically disappeared. What a joke.",2024-02-09 22:21:21,1
Only problem is that I regularly have to open X on the website since the images won't load quickly on the mobile app.,2024-02-05 00:14:08,5
Avidly promotes hate speech. Highly questionable moderation at best. New ownership doesn't seem like they know what they app to be.,2024-03-11 14:43:49,1
"Barely works. Takes 10 mins to load new posts, when you can get it to open at all.",2024-02-16 13:36:37,1
It's always an experience getting first-hand information here and meeting amazing knowledgeable people. We're yet to have complete freedom of speech here without being shadow-banned.,2024-02-24 07:05:27,4

Elon brought back a much higher level of free speech and removed a large amount of the fake bot accounts. It's great.,2024-03-10 13:30:33,5
Rate limit is dumb as can be. Would not recommend to new users. Not to mention the lot of bots following and liking posts.,2024-04-16 20:02:40,1

Very useless app It hangs when scrolling It seems like the net is slow while the net is also fine I was very disappointed with it,2024-02-27 19:44:57,1

"I originally left a review back in 2020 noting the bias/editorializing and the massive number of bots. I am happy to update my rating to 5/5 from 3/5 as the app has greatly improved since it's acquisition. The bias still appears from members, however it does not dominate your thread. I get a variety of viewpoints now. This intellectual diversity is refreshing given the blatant censorship of Meta and other social media sources. X is the version of Twitter we all knew we wanted.",2024-03-10 07:47:16,5
"If there's 0 I would give it a 0. Can't log in it always shows ""Something Try to login."" Which is totally annoying.",2024-03-20 07:44:10,1

"Obviously there is still moderation since Elon bought the platform, but it no longer feels like every political opinion besides progressive leftism is verboten.

"App works fine, morons getting weird ads and stuff like porn is a reflection on them and not the app's fault.

"The app keeps getting worse and worse, the new owner is a moron and the name change was just the latest in a series of increasingly embarrassingly stupid decisions regarding this app. Update: also old videos barely play anymore, they tend to play for a few seconds and then freeze like 80% of the time, the app is filled with bots with blue checks and there's more of them than ever before, the owner also purposely boosts racist, transphobic and antisemitic accounts.",2023-12-14 18:11:19,1

Well, we prefer the blue bird! The icon is so much lovely! And colorful! Instead of an x and dark icon? What are y'all emo? The blue bird literally represents Twitter!

"Community notes provide important context and help readers stay informed on every topic. Have found my feed to be well catered to my interests, even as a user who doesn't really post or follow anyone. In my opinion, X does a better job at fighting misinformation than any other social media platform, or at least displays its efforts in an honest and transparent way. Have found opinions on this platform to be wide and varied, which proves it to be a forum where many ideas can be freely expressed.",2023-12-23 00:26:58,5

For the past like month or so every interaction under a relevant tweet is filled with bots with blue checkmarks who clearly barely understand the language of the original post. Either that or OF promotion ooooor just other account posting their non related content on the comment section. Ads are shady AF and the recommended timeline is not as intuitive. The only decent thing are community notes.,2024-01-15 05:23:03,1

Best app if you are a person who likes to be updated on world events and developments. I am hooked X and I love the updates that these guys bring on a regular basis. All the latest news and hot topics for discussion are available here and you can express your views and interact with influential personalities. Best place for gamers and streamers too.

"Elon Musk is a pedophile and has the unnatural ability to ruin everything that it interacts with, it has done absolutely nothing beneficial with its life. It has killed apes with a microchip, its rockets can barely leave orbit without exploding, its cars are made with cheap plastic-like metal, and it has ruined not one, not two, but 3 different apps now that it's barely recognizable to how it was before.

Appeals are being ignored. I have been waiting for a reply for 10 days. The X site states it should only take 3 days! I'm being accused of violating their policy with my profile picture.
